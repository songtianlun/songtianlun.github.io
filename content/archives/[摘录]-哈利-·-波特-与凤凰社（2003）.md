1. There you go, Sirius, Harry thought dully. Nothing rash. Kept my nose clean. Exactly the opposite of what you’d have done … >>
2. 你可以放心了,小天狼星,哈利闷闷不乐地想,不做鲁莽的事,安分守己,跟你当年做的事情正好相反。 >>
3. “Expecto Patronum!” >>
4. “呼神护卫!” >>
5. EXPECTO PATRONUM!” >>
6. “呼神护卫!” >>
7. An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry’s wand; its antlers caught the dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backward, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the dementor swooped away, batlike and defeated. >>
8. 一头巨大的银色牡鹿从哈利的魔杖头上喷了出来,两根鹿角直刺向摄魂怪的心脏所在的地方。摄魂怪被撞得连连后退,像周围的黑暗一样没有重量。牡鹿冲上前去,摄魂怪像蝙蝠一样扑闪到一边,匆匆逃走了。 >>
9. “GET IT!” Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping back past him. The dementor’s eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley’s when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness. The stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist. >>
10. “抓住它!”哈利喊道,随着一阵快速的呼啸声,他变出来的那头银色牡鹿从他的身边跑过。摄魂怪那没有眼睛的脸离达力的脸只差不到一英寸了,说时迟那时快,银色的鹿角刺中了它,把它挑起来抛到半空。
它就像刚才它的那个同伴一样,腾空逃走,被黑暗吞没了。牡鹿慢跑到小巷尽头,化为一股银色烟雾消失了。 >>
11. “Don’t put it away, idiot boy!” she shrieked. “What if there are more of them around? Oh, I’m going to kill Mundungus Fletcher!” >>
12. “别藏啦,傻孩子!”她尖叫着说道,“如果周围还有他们的人怎么办呢?哦,我非宰了蒙顿格斯弗莱奇不可!” >>
13. we might as well be hanged for a dragon as an egg. >>
14. 为一条龙是一死,为一个蛋也是一死。 >>
15. The hall light was on. Harry stuck his wand back inside the waistband of his jeans, rang the bell, and watched Aunt Petunia’s outline grow larger and larger, oddly distorted by the rippling glass in the front door. >>
16. 客厅里亮着灯。哈利把魔杖重新插进牛仔裤的腰带,摁响了门铃。
佩妮姨妈的身影越来越大,被前门上起着波纹的玻璃折射得奇形怪状。 >>
17. “Ministry of Magic?” bellowed Uncle Vernon. “People like you in government? Oh this explains everything, everything, no wonder the country’s going to the dogs. …” >>
18. “魔法部?”弗农姨父恶声恶气地说道,“你们这样的人也能在政府工作?哦,我总算都明白了,都明白了,怪不得这个国家如今一天不如一天呢。” >>
19. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia exchanged looks of utter horror. If their least favorite thing in the world was magic, closely followed by neighbors who cheated more than they did on the hosepipe ban, people who heard voices were definitely in the bottom ten. They obviously thought Dudley was losing his mind. >>
20. 弗农姨父和佩妮姨妈交换了一个惊恐万状的眼神。如果说在这个世界上他们最不喜欢的东西是魔法——其次就是邻居在禁用浇水软管的问题上弄虚作假,做得比他们更过分——那么听到自己的脑子里有人说话,肯定也是最糟糕的事情之一。他们显然认为达力已经精神错乱了。>>
21. But Dudley seemed incapable of saying. He shuddered again and shook his large blond head, and despite the sense of numb dread that had settled on Harry since the arrival of the first owl, he felt a certain curiosity. Dementors caused a person to relive the worst moments of their life. … What would spoiled, pampered, bullying Dudley have been forced to hear? >>
22. 可是达力似乎不会说话了。他又打了个寒噤,摇了摇那颗亚麻色头发的大脑袋。尽管第一只猫头鹰到来后,哈利的内心因恐惧而近乎麻木了,但此刻他也感到有些好奇。摄魂怪能使人重新经历一生中最痛苦的时刻。那么,这个被溺爱的养尊处优的、横行霸道的达力,会被迫听到什么呢? >>
23. And now his temper was rising again. Wasn’t anybody going to say “well done” for fighting off two dementors singlehandedly? Both Mr. Weasley and Sirius were acting as though he’d misbehaved and they were saving their tellings-off until they could ascertain how much damage had been done. >>
24. 他的火气又上来了。他只身一人打跑了两个摄魂怪,难道就没有一个人对他说一声“干得漂亮”?看韦斯莱先生和小天狼星的反应就好像他做了什么错事,他们要等到弄清他造成了多大的破坏,再好好地训斥他一顿。 >>
25. But at these words of Uncle Vernon’s, Harry’s exhausted brain ground back into action. Why had the dementors come to Little Whinging? How could it be coincidence that they had arrived in the alleyway where Harry was? Had they been sent? Had the Ministry of Magic lost control of the dementors, had they deserted Azkaban and joined Voldemort, as Dumbledore had predicted they would? >>
26. 但是听了弗农姨父的话,哈利已经极度疲劳的大脑又开始吱吱嘎嘎地运转起来。摄魂怪为什么到小惠金区来?它们正好落在哈利所在的那条小巷里,这怎么可能是巧合呢?它们是被派来的吗?难道魔法部失去了对摄魂怪的控制?难道摄魂怪擅自逃离了阿兹卡班,加入了伏地魔一伙,就像邓布利多曾经预言的那样? >>
27. He registered dimly how strange it was that the Dursleys, who flinched, winced, and squawked if they heard words like “wizard,” “magic,” or “wand,” could hear the name of the most evil wizard of all time without the slightest tremor. >>
28. 他模模糊糊地意识到眼前的情景是多么奇怪:德思礼一家人听到“巫师”、“魔法”和“魔杖”这样的词都会吓得连连退缩,失声尖叫,而听到有史以来最邪恶的恶魔的名字,居然能没有一丝一毫的惊慌。 >>
29. And all of a sudden, for the very first time in his life, Harry fully appreciated that Aunt Petunia was his mother’s sister. >>
30. 突然之间,哈利有生以来第一次充分意识到佩妮姨妈是他妈妈的姐姐。 >>
31. Harry stood rooted to the spot. The letters from the Ministry, Mr.
Weasley, and Sirius were crushed in his left hand. Don’t leave the house again, whatever you do. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE’S HOUSE. >>
32. 哈利站在原地,脚底像生了根。魔法部、韦斯莱先生和小天狼星的来信都捏在他的左手里。无论如何,你千万别再离开那所房子。不要离开你姨妈和姨父的家。 >>
33. The silence spiraled horribly. >>
34. 寂静在可怕地升级。 >>
35. Up and down he paced, consumed with anger and frustration, grinding his teeth and clenching his fists, casting angry looks out at the empty, star-strewn sky every time he passed the window. Dementors sent to get him, Mrs. Figg and Mundungus Fletcher tailing him in secret, then suspension from Hogwarts and a hearing at the Ministry of Magic — and still no one was telling him what was going on. >>
36. 他踱过来踱过去,内心充满了火气和沮丧。他把牙齿咬得咯咯响, 拳头捏得紧紧的,每次经过窗口,都把愤怒的目光投向外面群星闪烁的空荡荡的夜空。摄魂怪被派来抓他,费格太太和蒙顿格斯弗莱奇在偷偷跟踪他,然后又被霍格沃茨暂时停学,还要到魔法部去受审——而且仍然没有一个人告诉他到底出了什么事情。 >>
37. He kicked his school trunk as he passed it, but far from relieving his anger he felt worse, as he now had a sharp pain in his toe to deal with in addition to the pain in the rest of his body. >>
38. 他走过上学用的箱子时,狠狠地踢了它一脚, 可是非但没有缓解他愤怒的心情,反而更糟糕了,现在他不仅要忍受身上其他地方的疼痛,脚趾也感到钻心的疼。 >>
39. Just as he limped past the window, Hedwig soared through it with a soft rustle of wings like a small ghost.“About time!” Harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage.“You can put that down, I’ve got work for you!”Hedwig’s large round amber eyes gazed reproachfully at him over the dead frog clamped in her beak. >>
40. 当他一瘸一拐地经过窗口时,海德薇像一个小幽灵似的轻轻扑棱着翅膀飞进了窗户。
“回来得是时候啊!”哈利看到它轻盈地落在笼子顶上,没好气地说,“赶紧把那玩意儿放下,我有活儿等着你干呢!”海德薇嘴里叼着一只死青蛙,一双圆溜溜的琥珀色大眼睛责备地望着他。 >>
41. “Come here,” said Harry, picking up the three small rolls of parchment and a leather thong and tying the scrolls to her scaly leg. “Take these straight to Sirius, Ron, and Hermione and don’t come back here without good long replies. Keep pecking them till they’ve written decent-length answers if you’ve got to. Understand?” >>
42. “过来。”哈利说着拿起那三小卷羊皮纸和一根皮带子,把羊皮纸拴在海德薇长满鳞片的腿上,“把这些直接送给小天狼星、罗恩和赫敏, 必须等拿到长长的回信再回来。如果需要,就不停地用嘴啄他们,逼他们写出长度合适的回信。明白了吗?” >>
43. He had recently spent nine months in what he had thought was Mad-Eye Moody’s company only to find out that it wasn’t Moody at all, but an impostor; an impostor, moreover, who had tried to kill Harry before being unmasked. >>
44. 就在最近,他曾跟那个他以为是疯眼汉穆迪的人一起待了九个月,结果发现那根本就不是穆迪,而是一个冒名顶替的家伙,而且,那家伙在暴露身份前还想杀死他。 >>
45. Harry blinked.
The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing intently up at him, some craning their heads for a better look. >>
46. 哈利眨了眨眼睛。
下面的人都挤在楼梯口,抬头目不转睛地望着他,有几个人还使劲伸长了脖子,好把他看得更清楚一些。 >>
47. Harry could hardly believe this was real. Four weeks with nothing, not the tiniest hint of a plan to remove him from Privet Drive, and suddenly a whole bunch of wizards was standing matter-of-factly in the house as though this were a long-standing arrangement. >>
48. 哈利简直不敢相信这一切都是真的。四个星期毫无音讯,没有一点蛛丝马迹显示要将他从女贞路转移出去,可是突然之间,一大堆巫师一本正经地站在这个家里,就好像这是早就安排好的事情。 >>
49. “Yeah, I know,” said Harry uncomfortably; it felt odd to be introduced to somebody he’d thought he’d known for a year. >>
50. “是啊,我知道。”哈利尴尬地说。一个自己以为认识了一年的人, 又被别人介绍来重新认识,这感觉真是很奇怪。 >>
51. “A surprising number of people volunteered to come and get you,” said Lupin, as though he had read Harry’s mind; the corners of his mouth twitched slightly. >>
52. “没想到那么多人主动提出要来接你。”卢平说,似乎读出了哈利的心思,两个嘴角微微动了动。 >>
53. The headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix may be found at number twelve, Grimmauld Place, London. >>
54. 凤凰社指挥部位于伦敦格里莫广场12号。 >>
55. The warm glow that had flared inside him at the sight of his two best friends was extinguished as something icy flooded the pit of his stomach. All of a sudden — after yearning to see them for a solid month — he felt he would rather Ron and Hermione left him alone. >>
56. 见到两个最要好朋友时的那种热乎乎的喜悦现在慢慢熄灭了,一股冷冰冰的东西涌进了他的内心深处。突然之间——虽然整整一个月眼巴巴地渴望见到他们——他却觉得情愿罗恩和赫敏走开,让他独自待着。 >>
57. Harry felt a great jolt in his guts as though he had just missed a step going downstairs. So everyone had known he was being followed except him. >>
58. 哈利感到心里猛地忽悠一下,好像下楼梯时一脚踏空了一样。这么说大家都知道他被人跟踪,只有他一个人蒙在鼓里。 >>
59. “He was so angry,” said Hermione in an almost awestruck voice.
“Dumbledore. We saw him. When he found out Mundungus had left before his shift had ended. He was scary.” >>
60. “他气极了,”赫敏用一种几乎战战兢兢的口吻说,“邓布利多。我们看见他了。当他弄清蒙顿格斯不到换岗时间就擅自离开时,他那副样子简直吓人。” >>
61. But before he knew it, Harry was shouting.
“SO YOU HAVEN’T BEEN IN THE MEETINGS, BIG DEAL! YOU’VE STILL BEEN HERE, HAVEN’T YOU? YOU’VE STILL BEEN TOGETHER! ME, I’VE BEEN STUCK AT THE DURSLEYS’ FOR A MONTH! AND I’VE HANDLED MORE THAN YOU TWO’VE EVER MANAGED AND DUMBLEDORE KNOWS IT — WHO SAVED THE SORCERER’S STONE? WHO GOT RID OF RIDDLE? WHO SAVED BOTH YOUR SKINS FROM THE DEMENTORS?” >>
62. 哈利不知不觉地喊了起来:“这么说你们没能参加会议,真是太遗憾了!但你们一直待在这里,是不是?你们一直待在一起!而我呢,我被困在德思礼家整整一个月!可我经历过的事情比你们俩都多,邓布利多明明知道这一点——是谁保住了魔法石?是谁除掉了里德尔?是谁从摄魂怪手里救了你们两个人的命?” >>
63. Every bitter and resentful thought that Harry had had in the past month was pouring out of him; his frustration at the lack of news, the hurt that they had all been together without him, his fury at being followed and not told about it: All the feelings he was half-ashamed of finally burst their boundaries. Hedwig took fright at the noise and soared off on top of the wardrobe again; Pigwidgeon twittered in alarm and zoomed even faster around their heads. >>
64. 过去一个月里哈利有过的每一个痛苦、怨恨的想法现在都一股脑儿地涌了出来:得不到消息时的焦虑不安,得知他们一直待在一起、惟独把他撇在一边时的委屈,被人跟踪、自己却蒙在鼓里的愤怒——所有这些令他感到屈辱的感觉,终于像决堤的洪水一样冲了出来。海德薇被他的声音吓坏了,抖抖翅膀飞回到衣柜顶上去了。小猪惊慌地吱吱叫着, 在他们头顶上嗖嗖地越飞越快。 >>
65. “Harry, we’re really sorry!” said Hermione desperately, her eyes now sparkling with tears. “You’re absolutely right, Harry — I’d be furious if it was me!” >>
66. “哈利,我们真的很抱歉!”赫敏不顾一切地说道,眼睛里已经闪着泪花,“你说得非常对,哈利——换了我也会生气的!” >>
67. Time is Galleons >>
68. “时间就是金加隆 >>
69. “Git,” said Fred idly. >>
70. “蠢蛋。”弗雷德懒洋洋地说。 >>
71. “Because every time Percy’s name’s mentioned, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying,” Fred said. >>
72. “因为每次提到珀西的名字,爸爸就把手里拿的东西砸得粉碎,妈妈就放声大哭。”弗雷德说。 >>
73. “Percy and Dad had a row,” said Fred. “I’ve never seen Dad row with anyone like that. It’s normally Mum who shouts. …” >>
74. “珀西和爸爸大吵了一架。”弗雷德说,“我从没见过爸爸跟谁吵成那样。平常总是妈妈大吵大嚷。” >>
75. “I’m coming to that. Dad reckons Fudge only wants Percy in his office because he wants to use him to spy on the family — and Dumbledore.”Harry let out a low whistle.
“Bet Percy loved that.” >>
76. “我正要说到这一点上呢。爸爸琢磨,福吉把珀西安排在自己的办公室,是想利用他监视我们家——监视邓布利多。”哈利轻轻吹出一声口哨,“我猜珀西肯定很爱听这话。” >>
77. Harry swore under his breath. He had always liked Percy least of Ron’s brothers, but he had never imagined he would say such things to Mr.
Weasley. >>
78. 哈利不出声地骂了几句。在罗恩几个哥哥中间,他一直最不喜欢珀西,但他压根儿也想不到珀西居然对韦斯莱先生说出那样的话。 >>
79. There was something about the slightly flattened tone of voice in which Sirius uttered Dumbledore’s name that told Harry that Sirius was not very happy with the headmaster either. Harry felt a sudden upsurge of affection for his godfather. >>
80. 小天狼星说出邓布利多的名字时声音显得有点儿消沉,这使哈利明白,小天狼星对校长也有点儿不满。哈利顿时对教父产生了一种亲切的情感。 >>
81. Three helpings of rhubarb crumble and custard later and the waistband on Harry’s jeans was feeling uncomfortably tight (which was saying something, as the jeans had once been Dudley’s). >>
82. 三份大黄面包屑,接着又是蛋奶糕,哈利牛仔裤的裤腰紧得难受了(这是很能说明问题的,因为那条牛仔裤本来是达力的)当 >>
83. He did not look at Mrs. Weasley. He had been touched by what she had said about his being as good as a son, but he was also impatient at her mollycoddling. … Sirius was right, he was not a child. >>
84. 他没有看韦斯莱夫人。刚才韦斯莱夫人说他就像她的亲生儿子一样,他很受感动,但同时他也被韦斯莱夫人对自己的过分溺爱弄得很不耐烦。小天狼星说得对,他已经不是一个小孩子了。 >>
85. For a split second, Harry considered telling Ron that he wouldn’t tell him a single word, that he could try a taste of being kept in the dark and see how he liked it. But the nasty impulse vanished as they looked at each other. >>
86. 刹那间,哈利想对罗恩说他一个字也不会告诉他,也让他尝尝披蒙在鼓里的滋味,看看好受不好受。但是当两人目光相对时,他那种小心眼的冲动一下子就消失了。 >>
87. “Thanks to you, Dumbledore was able to recall the Order of the Phoenix about an hour after Voldemort returned,” said Sirius. >>
88. “多亏了你,邓布利多才能够在伏地魔回来后不到一小时就重新召集了凤凰社。”小天狼星说。 >>
89. “Dumbledore’s got a shrewd idea,” said Lupin, “and Dumbledore’s shrewd ideas normally turn out to be accurate.” >>
90. “邓布利多有一个敏锐的感觉,”卢平说,“而邓布利多的敏锐感觉一般都被证明是准确的。” >>
91. “Fudge is frightened of him, you see,” said Tonks sadly. >>
92. “福吉害怕他,明白吗?”唐克斯悲哀地说。 >>
93. “Frightened of what he’s up to,” said Mr. Weasley. “You see, Fudge thinks Dumbledore’s plotting to overthrow him. He thinks Dumbledore wants to be Minister of Magic.” >>
94. “害怕他想做的事情。”韦斯莱先生说道,“福吉认为邓布利多在密谋推翻他。他认为邓布利多自己想当魔法部长。” >>
95. “Of course he doesn’t,” said Mr. Weasley. “He’s never wanted the Minister’s job, even though a lot of people wanted him to take it when Millicent Bagnold retired. Fudge came to power instead, but he’s never quite forgotten how much popular support Dumbledore had, even though Dumbledore never applied for the job.” >>
96. “他当然不想,”韦斯莱先生说,“他从来没想过要当部长,尽管米里森巴格诺退休时,许多人想让他接替部长职位。后来福吉掌了大权, 但他一直没有忘记曾经有多少人支持邓布利多,虽说邓布利多从来没有申请过这个职位。” >>
97. “Deep down, Fudge knows Dumbledore’s much cleverer than he is, a much more powerful wizard, and in the early days of his Ministry he was forever asking Dumbledore for help and advice,” said Lupin. “But it seems that he’s become fond of power now, and much more confident. He loves being Minister of Magic, and he’s managed to convince himself that he’s the clever one and Dumbledore’s simply stirring up trouble for the sake of it.” >>
98. “在内心深处,福吉知道邓布利多比他有智慧得多,巫师的法术也比他厉害得多。他刚开始当部长的时候,还三天两头向邓布利多讨教、求助。”卢平说,“但是后来他似乎喜欢上了权力,信心也增强了。他迷恋当魔法部长的感觉,而且他使自己相信,他才是有智慧的人,邓布利多只是为此故意制造事端。” >>
99. “Because accepting that Voldemort’s back would mean trouble like the Ministry hasn’t had to cope with for nearly fourteen years,” said Sirius bitterly. “Fudge just can’t bring himself to face it. It’s so much more comfortable to convince himself Dumbledore’s lying to destabilize him.” >>
100. “因为如果承认伏地魔回来了,那就意味着有大麻烦,这种麻烦魔法部已经有将近十四年没有碰到了。”小天狼星尖刻地说,“福吉只是没有勇气面对这件事。他让自己相信邓布利多是在散布谣言,破坏他的稳定地位,这样一想就轻松多了。” >>
101. He’s in charge of the hunt for Sirius, so he’s been feeding the Ministry information that Sirius is in Tibet. >>
102. 负责追捕小天狼星,所以他一直向部里提供信息说小天狼星在西藏。 >>
103. “We want to experiment with doxy venom for our Skiving Snackboxes,”George told Harry under his breath. >>
104. “我们想用狐猸子的毒液做实验,研制我们的速效逃课糖。”乔治压低声音对哈利说。 >>
105. “Range of sweets to make you ill,” George whispered, keeping a wary eye on Mrs. Weasley’s back. “Not seriously ill, mind, just ill enough to get you out of a class when you feel like it. Fred and I have been developing them this summer. They’re double-ended, color-coded chews. If you eat the orange half of the Puking Pastilles, you throw up. Moment you’ve been rushed out of the lesson for the hospital wing, you swallow the purple half —” >>
106. “各种各样让你犯病的糖果,”乔治小声说,一边警惕地留意着韦斯莱夫人的背影,“记住,不是犯重病,而是刚好在你不想上课的时候能让你离开课堂。弗雷德和我这个夏天一直在研制它们。是一种双色口香糖,一头是橘黄色的,另一头是紫色的。如果你吃下这种吐吐糖那橘黄色的一半,你就会呕吐。等你冲出教室到医院去时,你再吞下那紫色的一半——” >>
107. “It makes such a nice change.” >>
108. “换换口味真不赖。” >>
109. “The pureblood families are all interrelated,” said Sirius. “If you’re only going to let your sons and daughters marry purebloods your choice is very limited, there are hardly any of us left. Molly and I are cousins by marriage and Arthur’s something like my second cousin once removed. But there’s no point looking for them on here — if ever a family was a bunch of blood traitors it’s the Weasleys.” >>
110. “纯血统的家庭之间互相都有亲戚关系。”小天狼星说道,“如果你只想让你的儿女同纯血统的人结婚,那你的选择余地就非常有限了。我们这种人已经所剩无几了。莫丽和我是有姻亲关系的表姐弟,亚瑟大概算是我叔伯祖父的曾外孙吧。但在这上面寻找他们是没有用的——如果有哪个家里都是一伙玷污血统的败类,那准是韦斯莱一家了。” >>
111. Harry understood completely. He knew how he would feel if forced, when he was grown up and thought he was free of the place forever, to return and live at number four, Privet Drive. >>
112. 哈利完全能理解。他知道,如果他长大成人,以为永远摆脱女贞路四号了,结果又回到那个地方生活,那会是一种什么感觉。 >>
113. Dumbledore’s Secret-Keeper for the Order, you know — nobody can find headquarters unless he tells them personally where it is — that note Moody showed you last night, that was from Dumbledore. …” >>
114. 邓布利多是凤凰社的保密人——谁也不可能找到指挥部,除非他亲自告诉他们地址——就是昨天晚上穆迪给你看的那张纸条,是从邓布利多那里拿来的 >>
115. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut >>
116. 还有一个音乐盒,一拧发条,就隐隐约约地发出丁丁冬冬的不祥乐曲,接着他们都发现自己莫名其妙地变得虚弱无力,昏昏欲睡,幸亏金妮脑子还算清楚,赶紧将盖子关上了。 >>
117. Snape might refer to their work as “cleaning,” but in Harry’s opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. >>
118. 斯内普大概喜欢把他们的工作称为“大扫除”,但在哈利看来,他们实际上是在对老房子发动一场战争,老房子在克利切的帮助下,进行着十分顽强的抵抗。 >>
119. Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny all stopped talking and looked over at him. Harry nodded and tried to keep eating his chops, but his mouth had become so dry he could not chew. >>
120. 罗恩、赫敏、弗雷德、乔治和金妮都停止了谈话,朝他这边望着。
哈利点点头,还想继续吃他的排骨,但嘴里突然变得很干,简直嚼不动了。 >>
121. The thought that Dumbledore had been in the house on the eve of his hearing and not asked to see him made him feel, if that were possible, even worse. >>
122. 邓布利多在他受审的前夜来过这所房子,却没有提出来要见他, 想到这一点,他原本就糟糕透顶的心情更加恶劣了。 >>
123. “She’s fair, she’ll hear you out.” >>
124. “她很公正,会听你把话说完的。” >>
125. Harry walked closer to him and the wizard held up a long golden rod, thin and flexible as a car aerial, and passed it up and down Harry’s front and back >>
126. 哈利走近他面前,那巫师举起一根长长的金棒,像汽车的天线一样细细的,很有韧性,他用它在哈利的前胸后背从上到下扫了一遍。 >>
127. raise. … Just round here, Harry. >>
128. 上次我们这里刮了两个月的飓风, 因为他们想涨工资……差不多就在这里,哈利。” >>
129. “Quick, Harry, we should have been there five minutes ago!” >>
130. “快点儿,哈利,我们应该五分钟前就到那里的!” >>
131. Harry’s heart was beating a violent tattoo against his Adam’s apple. He swallowed hard, turned the heavy iron door handle, and stepped inside the courtroom. >>
132. 哈利狂跳的心脏扑通扑通地撞击着他的喉结。他费力地咽了口唾沫,拧了一下门上沉重的铁把手,走进了审判室。 >>
133. “— Witness for the defense, Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore,”said a quiet voice from behind Harry, who turned his head so fast he cricked his neck. >>
134. “被告方证人:阿不思·珀西瓦尔·伍尔弗里克·布赖恩·邓布利多。”哈利身后一个平静的声音说道。哈利猛一转头,差点儿把脖子扭伤了。 >>
135. A powerful emotion had risen in Harry’s chest at the sight of Dumbledore, a fortified, hopeful feeling rather like that which phoenix song gave him. He wanted to catch Dumbledore’s eye, but Dumbledore was not looking his way; he was continuing to look up at the obviously flustered Fudge. >>
136. 哈利看见邓布利多,内心就升起一股强烈的情感,让他感到踏实, 充满了希望,就像凤凰福克斯歌声曾经带给他的感觉一样。他想与邓布利多对一下目光,但邓布利多没有朝他这边看,而是继续抬眼望着显然惊慌失措的福吉。 >>
137. “I must have missed it,” said Dumbledore cheerfully. “However, due to a lucky mistake I arrived at the Ministry three hours early, so no harm done.” >>
138. 看来我是没收到,”邓布利多语气欢快地说,“不过,我犯了一个幸运的错误,提前三个小时就来到了魔法部,所以没造成妨碍。” >>
139. “Merlin’s beard,” said Mr. Weasley wonderingly, pulling Harry aside to let them all pass, “you were tried by the full court?”“I think so,” said Harry quietly. >>
140. “我的天哪——”韦斯莱先生惊讶地喊了起来,把哈利拉到一边,让他们过去,“他们正式开庭审判你?”“我想是的。”哈利轻声说。 >>
141. “So what will you have to do about the toilet?” Harry asked, grinning.
Everything suddenly seemed five times funnier than usual. It was starting to sink in: He was cleared, he was going back to Hogwarts. >>
142. “那么,你准备怎么对付那间厕所呢?”哈利咧嘴笑着问。突然之间,所有的事情似乎都比平常好玩了五倍。他终于开始明白:他被宣告无罪了,他就要回霍格沃茨去了。 >>
143. Harry felt winded, as though he had just walked into something heavy.
He had last seen those cool gray eyes through slits in a Death Eater’s hood, and last heard that man’s voice jeering in a dark graveyard while Lord Voldemort tortured him. He could not believe that Lucius Malfoy dared look him in the face; he could not believe that he was here, in the Ministry of Magic, or that Cornelius Fudge was talking to him, when Harry had told Fudge mere weeks ago that Malfoy was a Death Eater. >>
144. 哈利突然觉得透不过气来,似乎他一脚跨进了某个凝固的东西里。
他上次看见这两只冷冰冰的灰眼睛时,它们隐藏在食死徒兜帽的两道狭缝后面;他上次听见这个男人的声音,是在阴暗的墓地里发出的阵阵嘲笑,而当时伏地魔正在折磨他。哈利不敢相信卢修斯·马尔福竟然还敢当面看着他,他不敢相信马尔福竟然出现在这里,在堂堂的魔法部,而康奈利·福吉竟然在跟他说话,要知道哈利几个星期前曾亲口对福吉说过马尔福是个食死徒。 >>
145. “Gold, I expect,” said Mr. Weasley angrily. “Malfoy’s been giving generously to all sorts of things for years. … Gets him in with the right people … then he can ask favors … delay laws he doesn’t want passed …Oh, he’s very well connected, Lucius Malfoy. …” >>
146. “我想是金子吧。”韦斯莱先生气愤地说,“许多年来,马尔福一直对各种各样的人出手很大方……好使自己跟有权势的人攀上交情……然后可以要求特殊照顾……让那些他不想通过的法律一拖再拖……哦,卢修斯·马尔福,他真是能量不小,神通广大。” >>
147. “One sacked, one dead, one’s memory removed, and one locked in a trunk for nine months,” said Harry, counting them off on his fingers. “Yeah, I see what you mean.” >>
148. “一个被开除了,一个死了,一个被消除了记忆,还有一个被锁在箱子里整整九个月。”哈利掰着指头一个个地数,“是啊,我明白你们的意思了。” >>
149. I don’t believe it! I don’t believe it! Oh, Ron, how wonderful! A prefect! That’s everyone in the family!”“What are Fred and I, next-door neighbors?” said George indignantly, as his mother pushed him aside and flung her arms around her youngest son. >>
150. I >>
151. “我真不敢相信!我真不敢相信!哦,罗恩,真是太棒了!级长! 家里的每个人都是级长!”“弗雷德和我算什么?隔壁邻居吗?”乔治愤愤不平地说,他母亲把他推到一边,张开双臂搂住了她最小的儿子。 >>
152. He had forgotten completely about prefects being chosen in the fifth year.
He had been too anxious about the possibility of being expelled to spare a thought for the fact that badges must be winging their way toward certain people. But if he had remembered … if he had thought about it … what would he have expected? >>
153. 他已经把五年级要挑选级长的事情忘得一干二净。他一直忧心忡忡地担心会被开除,根本没有心思去想徽章正扇动着翅膀朝某些人飞来。
但如果他没有忘记……如果他曾经想过……他会希望有什么结果呢? >>
154. Harry screwed up his face and buried it in his hands. He could not lie to himself; if he had known the prefect badge was on its way, he would have expected it to come to him, not Ron. Did this make him as arrogant as Draco Malfoy? Did he think himself superior to everyone else? Did he really believe he was better than Ron? No, said the small voice defiantly.
Was that true? Harry wondered, anxiously probing his own feelings. >>
155. 选级长,他肯定希望选中的是自己,而不是罗恩。他这是不是像德拉科·马尔福一样狂妄自大呢?他难道认为自己比别人都了不起?他真的相信自己比罗恩出色? 不。那个小声音斩钉截铁地说。
真的吗?哈利疑惑地想,急于把自己的感觉探究个水落石出。 >>
156. Not all the time, though, Harry argued with himself. They didn’t fight Quirrell with me. They didn’t take on Riddle and the basilisk. They didn’t get rid of all those dementors the night Sirius escaped. They weren’t in that graveyard with me, the night Voldemort returned. …And the same feeling of ill usage that had overwhelmed him on the night he had arrived rose again. I’ve definitely done more, Harry thought indignantly. I’ve done more than either of them! >>
157. 是总在一起,哈利同自己辩论道。他们没有和我一起同奇洛搏斗。他们没有跟里德尔和蛇怪较量。他们没有在小天狼星逃跑的那天晚上摆脱那些摄魂怪。在伏地魔回来的那天夜里,他们没有在墓地里和我在一起……想到这里,他刚来的那天晚上感到自己受到不公平待遇的那种强烈感觉又一次在心头翻滚。我绝对做得更多,哈利气愤不平地说。我做得比他们俩都多! >>
158. But maybe, said the small voice fairly, maybe Dumbledore doesn’t choose prefects because they’ve got themselves into a load of dangerous situations.
… Maybe he chooses them for other reasons. … Ron must have something you don’t. … >>
159. 可是,那个小声音公正地说,也许邓布利多选级长并不看中他们经历过多少危险处境……也许他选级长看的是其他因素……罗恩肯定具有一些你所没有的东西…… >>
160. Harry opened his eyes and stared through his fingers at the wardrobe’s clawed feet, remembering what Fred had said.
“No one in their right mind would make Ron a prefect. …”Harry gave a small snort of laughter. A second later he felt sickened with himself. >>
161. 哈利睁开眼睛,透过手指缝望着衣柜爪子形的脚,想起了弗雷德说过的话:“头脑清楚的人,谁会选罗恩当级长呢……”哈利发出一声嘲讽的轻笑,但随即又为自己感到恶心。 >>
162. Ginny laughed; Hermione looked as though she did not know whether to smile or not and compromised by taking an extra large gulp of butterbeer and choking on it. >>
163. 金妮哈哈大笑。赫敏似乎不知道是不是也该笑一笑,便采取个折中的办法,端起杯子喝了一大口黄油啤酒,结果被呛着了。 >>
164. “No one would have made me a prefect, I spent too much time in detention with James. Lupin was the good boy, he got the badge.” >>
165. “没有人会选我当级长的,我花了那么多时间跟詹姆一起关禁闭。
卢平是个好孩子,他得到了徽章。” >>
166. Harry’s mood suddenly lifted. His father had not been a prefect either. All at once the party seemed much more enjoyable; he loaded up his plate, feeling unusually fond of everyone in the room. >>
167. 哈利的情绪突然好了起来。他父亲当年也不是级长。顿时,晚会似乎变得好玩多了。他把盘子装得满满的,觉得自己加倍地喜爱房间里的每一个人。 >>
168. And then, to see them surrounded by all those other happy faces … Benjy Fenwick, who had been found in bits, and Gideon Prewett, who had died like a hero, and the Longbottoms, who had been tortured into madness … all waving happily out of the photograph forevermore, not knowing that they were doomed. … Well, Moody might find that interesting … he, Harry, found it disturbing. … >>
169. 还有,看见他们周围所有那些愉快的面孔……本吉·芬威克,只找到一些尸体的残片,吉迪翁·普威特,像英雄一样勇敢战死,还有隆巴顿夫妇,被折磨成了疯子……他们都永远在照片上愉快地挥着手,谁也不知道前面等着他们的厄运……唉,穆迪大概会觉得这很有趣……他, 哈利,觉得这让人心神不安…… >>
170. But Harry, closing his bedroom door behind him some ten minutes later, could not think Mrs. Weasley silly. He could still see his parents beaming up at him from the tattered old photograph, unaware that their lives, like so many of those around them, were drawing to a close. The image of the boggart posing as the corpse of each member of Mrs. Weasley’s family in turn kept flashing before his eyes. >>
171. 可是十分钟后,当哈利反手关上卧室的房门时,他无法认为韦斯莱夫人是在犯傻。他仍然能够看见他爸爸妈妈从那张破烂的旧照片上笑眯眯地望着他,他们像周围的那么多人一样,浑然不知他们的生命就要终结。哈利眼前不断闪现着博格特轮番变出韦斯莱夫人家每个人的尸体的景象。 >>
172. Harry ignored it. He felt older than he had ever felt in his life, and it seemed extraordinary to him that barely an hour ago he had been worried about a joke shop and who had gotten a prefect’s badge. >>
173. 哈利没去理它。他感到自己一下子长大了很多,以前从没有过这种感觉,可就在一个小时前,他还在担心笑话商店的事,担心谁得到了级长的徽章,这使他觉得不可思议。 >>
174. But as Hermione and Ron dragged their trunks, Crookshanks, and a caged Pigwidgeon off toward the engine end of the train, Harry felt an odd sense of loss. He had never traveled on the Hogwarts Express without Ron. >>
175. 但是当赫敏和罗恩拖着箱子、抱着克鲁克山、拎着小猪的笼子朝火车头的方向走去时,哈利还是有了一种奇怪的失落感。以前每次乘坐霍格沃茨特快列车,他都是跟罗恩在一起的。 >>
176. Harry slumped back in his seat and groaned. He would have liked Cho to discover him sitting with a group of very cool people laughing their heads off at a joke he had just told; he would not have chosen to be sitting with Neville and Loony Lovegood, clutching a toad and dripping in Stinksap. >>
177. 哈利垂头耷脑地倒在座位上,唉声叹气。他真希望秋看见他和一群很酷的人坐在一起,他们被他讲的一个笑话逗得乐不可支。他真不愿意被她看见自己跟纳威和疯姑娘洛夫古德坐在一起,手里拿着一只癞蛤蟆,脸上淌着臭汁。 >>
178. The Sorting Hat usually confined itself to describing the different qualities looked for by each of the four Hogwarts Houses and its own role in sorting them; Harry could not remember it ever trying to give the school advice before. >>
179. 通常,分院帽只描述霍格沃茨四个学院所看重的不同品质以及它自己给学生分类的任务。哈利不记得它什么时候试图给学校提出忠告。 >>
180. “The hat feels itself honor-bound to give the school due warning whenever it feels —” >>
181. Harry was somehow soothed to see Dumbledore standing before them all, whatever his recent bitter feelings toward his headmaster. Between the absence of Hagrid and the presence of those dragonish horses, he had felt that his return to Hogwarts, so long anticipated, was full of unexpected surprises like jarring notes in a familiar song. But this, at least, was how it was supposed to be: their headmaster rising to greet them all before the start-of- term feast. >>
182. 尽管哈利最近对他的校长有过种种不满的情绪,但此刻看到邓布利多站在他们大家面前,他还是松了口气。海格不见了踪影,马车前面突然出现了那些像龙一样的怪马,使他觉得他这次返回霍格沃茨,尽管是他梦寐以求的,却充满令他吃惊的意外,就像一首熟悉的歌曲里出现了不和谐的音符。但眼下的情形至少是正常的:在开学宴会开始前,他们的校长站起来问候他们大家。 >>
183. Yes, I have heard the hat give several warnings before, always at times when it detects periods of great danger for the school. And always, of course, its advice is the same: Stand together, be strong from within.” >>
184. “是啊,我以前好几次听过分院帽提出警告,总是在它感觉到学校面临着巨大危险的时候。
当然啦,它的忠告每次都是一样的:团结一致,保持内部的稳定。” >>
185. Harry found his attentiveness ebbing, as though his brain was slipping in and out of tune. The quiet that always filled the Hall when Dumbledore was speaking was breaking up as students put their heads together, whispering and giggling. >>
186. 哈利发现自己的注意力渐渐不集中了,似乎他的大脑开起了小差。
邓布利多说话时四下里鸦雀无声,现在同学们都在交头接耳,窃窃私语,咯咯发笑,礼堂里一片嘈杂。 >>
187. Professor Umbridge did not seem to notice the restlessness of her audience. Harry had the impression that a full-scale riot could have broken out under her nose and she would have plowed on with her speech. The teachers, however, were still listening very attentively, and Hermione seemed to be drinking in every word Umbridge spoke, though judging by her expression, they were not at all to her taste. >>
188. 乌姆里奇教授似乎没有注意到听众的坐立不安。哈利有一种感觉, 即使她鼻子底下发生一场大规模的暴动,她也会继续慢条斯理地演讲下去。然而教师们一个个听得都很仔细,赫敏似乎全神贯注地把乌姆里奇说的每一个字都听进去了,但从她的表情看,这些话她并不爱听。 >>
189. “Thank you very much, Professor Umbridge, that was most illuminating,” >>
190. “非常感谢你,乌姆里奇教授,你的讲话非常有启发性。” >>
191. “I said illuminating, not enjoyable,” said Hermione. “It explained a lot.” >>
192. “我说的是有启发性,不是有趣味性,”赫敏说,“它能说明许多问题。” >>
193. “I’ll tell you what it means,” said Hermione ominously. “It means the Ministry’s interfering at Hogwarts.” >>
194. “我来告诉你是什么意思吧,”赫敏咬着牙说,“这就说明魔法部在干预霍格沃茨。” >>
195. “She believes the Daily Prophet?” said Harry. “She thinks I’m a liar and Dumbledore’s an old fool?” >>
196. “她相信了《预言家日报》?”哈利问,“她认为我是个骗子,邓布利多是个老糊涂?” >>
197. My gran’s always said You-Know-Who would come back one day. She says if Dumbledore says he’s back, he’s back.” >>
198. Had Dumbledore suffered like this all summer, as first the Wizengamot, then the International Confederation of Wizards had thrown him from their ranks? Was it anger at Harry, perhaps, that had stopped Dumbledore getting in touch with him for months? The two of them were in this together, after all; Dumbledore had believed Harry, announced his version of events to the whole school and then to the wider Wizarding community. Anyone who thought Harry was a liar had to think that Dumbledore was too or else that Dumbledore had been hoodwinked. … >>
199. 是不是邓布利多整个暑假都在忍受这些?先被威森加摩开除,然后又被国际魔法师联合会扫地出门?是不是邓布利多生哈利的气了,这才好几个月一直没有跟他联系?不管怎么说,他们俩现在是拴在一起了。
邓布利多相信了哈利,把他叙述的事情经过告诉了全校师生,然后又向范围更广的巫师界公布了。凡是认为哈利是在说谎的人,都会认为邓布利多也是个骗子,或者认为邓布利多受了蒙蔽…… >>
200. They’ll know we’re right in the end, thought Harry miserably, as Ron got into bed and extinguished the last candle in the dormitory. But he wondered how many attacks like Seamus’s he would have to endure before that time came. >>
201. 他们最后总会知道我们是对的,哈利愁闷地想,这时罗恩上了床, 吹灭了宿舍里的最后一根蜡烛。可是哈利接着又想,在那个时候到来之前,他还要忍受多少像西莫这样的责难呢。 >>
202. “No,” said Hermione calmly, “I told her to keep her big fat mouth shut about you, actually. And it would be quite nice if you stopped jumping down Ron’s and my throats, Harry, because if you haven’t noticed, we’re on your side.” >>
203. “不是,”赫敏心平气和地说,“实际上,我叫她闭上她那张大胖嘴,不许再对你说三道四。哈利,真希望你不要再对我们横加指责,因为我和罗恩是和你站在一边的,除非你没有注意到。” >>
204. “About You-Know-Who. He said, ‘His gift for spreading discord and enmity is very great. We can fight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust —’ ” >>
205. “关于神秘人的。邓布利多说他‘制造冲突和敌意的手段十分高明。
我们只有表现出同样牢不可破的友谊和信任——’” >>
206. “The point,” Hermione pressed on loudly, “is that this sort of thing is exactly what Dumbledore was talking about. You-Know-Who’s only been back two months, and we’ve started fighting among ourselves. And the Sorting Hat’s warning was the same — stand together, be united —” >>
207. “问题是,”赫敏很不客气地大声说,“这些才是邓布利多真正要说的话。神秘人回来才两个月,我们就已经开始自相争斗了。分院帽的警告也是同样的意思:团结一致——” >>
208. “It’s best to know what the enemy are saying,” said Hermione darkly >>
209. “最好了解一下敌人在说什么。”赫敏一本正经地说。 >>
210. “Ask us no questions and we’ll tell you no lies, Hermione. >>
211. 别问我们,我们不会编谎话骗你,赫敏。 >>
212. Professor Binns, their ghost teacher, had a wheezy, droning voice that was almost guaranteed to cause severe drowsiness within ten minutes, five in warm weather. >>
213. 他们的鬼魂老师宾斯先生说起话来呼哧带喘,拖腔拖调,几乎肯定能在十分钟内使人昏昏欲睡;如他们就在底下做笔记,或者更准确地说,是在睡眼矇眬地发愣 >>
214. Today they suffered through three quarters of an hour’s droning on the subject of giant wars. Harry heard just enough within the first ten minutes to appreciate dimly that in another teacher’s hands this subject might have been mildly interesting, but then his brain disengaged, and he spent the remaining thirty-five minutes playing hangman on a corner of his parchment with Ron, while Hermione shot them filthy looks out of the corner of her eye. >>
215. 今天,他们忍受着宾斯教授拖着腔调地讲述巨人战争的话题,足足忍受了一个半小时。哈利刚听了十分钟,就模模糊糊地意识到如果换了另外一位老师,这个题目大概会比较引人入胜,接着他的大脑就走神了,在剩下来的一小时二十分钟里,他和罗恩一直在他羊皮纸的一角玩刽子手的游戏,赫敏不时用眼角的余光狠狠地瞪着他们。 >>
216. We do try,” said Ron. “We just haven’t got your brains or your memory or your concentration — you’re just cleverer than we are — is it nice to rub it in?”“Oh, don’t give me that rubbish,” said Hermione, but she looked slightly mollified as she led the way out into the damp courtyard. >>
217. “我们努力来着,”罗恩说道,“我们只是没有你那样的大脑,你那样的记性、那样好的注意力——你就是比我们聪明嘛——你就不要哪壶不开提哪壶了好不好?”“哼,别给我灌这些迷魂汤。”赫敏说,但她的表情微微缓和了些, 领头来到外面湿乎乎的院子里。 >>
218. She walked away. Hermione waited until Cho was halfway across the courtyard before rounding on Ron.
“You are so tactless!”“What? I only asked her if —”“Couldn’t you tell she wanted to talk to Harry on her own?”“So? She could’ve done, I wasn’t stopping —”“What on earth were you attacking her about her Quidditch team for?”“Attacking? I wasn’t attacking her, I was only —”“Who cares if she supports the Tornados?”“Oh, come on, half the people you see wearing those badges only bought them last season —”“But what does it matter?”“It means they’re not real fans, they’re just jumping on the bandwagon —” >>
219. 她走开了。赫敏等到秋走到院子中间,便回过头来责骂罗恩。
“你太不懂事了!”“什么?我不过问她是不是——”“你难道看不出来,她是想跟哈利单独谈谈吗?”“那又怎么样?她完全可以谈嘛,我又没有拦着她——”“你凭什么对她支持的魁地奇球队横加指责?”“指责?我没有指责她,我只是——”“谁在乎她支持不支持龙卷风队?”“哦,得啦,你看见戴着那些徽章的人,一半都是上个赛季刚买的——”“可那又有什么关系?”“那就说明他们并不是真正的球迷,他们只是跟风,赶浪头——” >>
220. The surface of Hermione’s potion, however, was a shimmering mist of silver vapor, and as Snape swept by he looked down his hooked nose at it without comment, which meant that he could find nothing to criticize. >>
221. 赫敏的药剂倒是正冒出一股微微闪烁的银白色蒸汽,当斯内普快步走过时,鹰钩鼻上的眼睛低垂着看了看赫敏的坩埚,没有做任何评论,这就是说他挑不出任何毛病。 >>
222. Neither of the others answered; all three of them knew that Snape and Harry’s mutual enmity had been absolute from the moment Harry had set foot in Hogwarts >>
223. 赫敏和罗恩谁也没有回答。三个人心里都清楚,斯内普和哈利之间的敌意,从哈利踏进霍格沃茨的那一刻起就已经根深蒂固了。 >>
224. Poisonous toadstools don’t change their spots, >>
225. “毒蘑菇是不会改变它们的斑点的, >>
226. Many of the class exchanged gloomy looks; the order “wands away” had never yet been followed by a lesson they had found interesting. >>
227. 许多同学交换着郁闷的眼神。跟在“收起魔杖”这个命令后面的,从来都不是他们觉得有趣的课。 >>
228. It was desperately dull, quite as bad as listening to Professor Binns. He felt his concentration sliding away from him; he had soon read the same line half a dozen times without taking in more than the first few words. >>
229. 内容十分枯燥,简直就跟听宾斯教授讲课一样毫无趣味。他感到自己的注意力一点点地减退了。很快,他就盯着一行文字看了六七遍,却只看懂了开头几个单词。几 >>
230. When more than half the class were staring at Hermione rather than at their books, Professor Umbridge seemed to decide that she could ignore the situation no longer. >>
231. 后来,班上超过一半的同学都在盯着赫敏,而不是看着他们的课本了,乌姆里奇教授似乎认为她再也不能对这种情况视而不见了。 >>
232. “Well, I don’t,” said Hermione bluntly. “There’s nothing written up there about using defensive spells.” >>
233. “可是,我不这么认为,”赫敏直言不讳地说,“那上面一个字也没有提到使用防御性咒语。” >>
234. For heaven’s sake, Potter!” said Professor McGonagall, straightening her glasses angrily (she had winced horribly when he had used Voldemort’s name). “Do you really think this is about truth or lies? It’s about keeping your head down and your temper under control!” >>
235. 刚才她听见哈利说出伏地魔的名字,脸部肌肉很厉害地抽搐了一下),“你真的以为问题在于说实话还是说谎话吗?问题在于你必须低着头做人,尽量不招惹麻烦,管好你自己的脾气!” >>
236. “Well, I’m glad you listen to Hermione Granger at any rate,” she said, pointing him out of her office. >>
237. He knew she was watching him for signs of weakness and he was not going to show any, not even if he had to sit here all night, cutting open his own hand with this quill. >>
238. 他知道她在注视他,看他有没有软弱的迹象,他不想显露出一丝一毫的软弱,即使他要在这里坐一整夜,用这支羽毛笔把自己的手深深地割开…… >>
239. Harry opened his mouth, closed it again, and nodded. He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge’s room: He only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it. >>
240. 哈利张了张嘴又闭上了,随即点了点头。他也不明白自己为什么不想把乌姆里奇办公室里发生的一切告诉罗恩和赫敏。他只知道他不想看到他们脸上惊恐的表情,那只会使事情显得更加糟糕,因而也就更难面对。他还隐隐约约地感到,这是他和乌姆里奇之间的事情,是一场秘密的意志较量,他不想让她听到他在哭诉埋怨并因此而感到快意。 >>
241. Harry had the distinct impression that he was not alone in concealing things at the moment >>
242. 哈利有一个很清楚的感觉:此刻隐瞒事情真相的不止他一个人。 >>
243. He had never before considered the possibility that there might be another teacher in the world he hated more than Snape, but as he walked back toward Gryffindor Tower he had to admit he had found a contender. >>
244. 哈利以前认为,他不可能恨世界上的哪个老师比恨斯内普更厉害, 可是当他走回格兰芬多的塔楼时,他不得不承认为斯内普找到了一位强有力的竞争对手。 >>
245. These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts. >>
246. 当然,这些都是十分渺茫的希望之光,可是哈利目前的处境一片黑暗,但凡有什么事情能带来一点点光亮,他都会感到欣慰。他在霍格沃茨还从未经历过比这更糟糕的开学第一个星期呢。 >>
247. Harry looked into her face, which was shining with glee, and tried to look as though he was vaguely tempted by this offer. >>
248. 哈利仔细望着她的脸,发现那上面闪烁着喜悦的光芒,他竭力显出对她提出的建议有点儿动心的样子 >>
249. She blinked her amber eyes once and he took that to mean that she understood. >>
250. 海德薇眨了一下琥珀色的眼睛,哈利知道这表示它听明白了。 >>
251. “Nice day,” he said, gesturing to the windows. His insides seemed to shrivel with embarrassment. The weather. He was talking about the weather.
… >>
252. “天气真不错。”他说着指了指窗外。他的五脏六腑似乎都因尴尬而缩成了一团。天气。他居然在谈天气…… >>
253. “Sorry …” Ron repeated, his red face shining like a beacon against the bright blue sky. >>
254. “对不起……”罗恩又说了一遍,他的脸在蔚蓝色天空的衬托下,像烽火台一样红得发亮。 >>
255. “Give it back,” said Ron, holding out his hand. “He is —” Ron said jerkily, tearing Percy’s letter in half, “the world’s” — he tore it into quarters — “biggest” — he tore it into eighths — “git.” He threw the pieces into the fire. >>
256. “把信还给我,”罗恩伸出手说,“他是——”罗恩冲动地说,一把将珀西的信撕成两半,“世界上——”他将信撕成四片,“最大的——”他将信撕成八片,“傻瓜。”他把碎纸片扔进了炉火。 >>
257. He also felt an odd, sick, empty feeling in his stomach that had nothing to do with tiredness and everything to do with the letter now curling blackly in the heart of the fire. >>
258. 他还感到内心有一种空落落的、不舒服的异样感觉,这感觉跟疲劳没有关系,而跟此刻在炉火里卷成黑色灰烬的那封信大有关系。 >>
259. He knew that half the people inside Hogwarts thought him strange, even mad; he knew that the Daily Prophet had been making snide allusions to him for months, but there was something about seeing it written down like that in Percy’s writing, about knowing that Percy was advising Ron to drop him and even to tell tales on him to Umbridge, that made his situation real to him as nothing else had. He had known Percy for four years, had stayed in his house during the summers, shared a tent with him during the Quidditch World Cup, had even been awarded full marks by him in the second task of the Triwizard Tournament last year, yet now, Percy thought him unbalanced and possibly violent. >>
260. 他知道霍格沃茨校内一半的人都认为他很古怪,甚至很疯狂。他知道《预言家日报》几个月来一直别有用心地在提及他,但是此刻看见珀西信里白纸黑字地写着那样的话,得知珀西建议罗恩与他断绝关系,甚至到乌姆里奇那里去告他的状,他这才第一次真真切切地认识到自己的处境。他已经认识珀西四年了,暑假曾住在他们家里,魁地奇球世界杯赛时还跟他合住一个帐篷,甚至在上学期的三强争霸赛的第二个项目中,还从他那里得到过满分,然而现在,珀西认为他精神错乱,还可能有暴力倾向。 >>

266. “对詹姆来说,只有冒险才是有趣的。 >>
267. Hermione was breathing fast and her eyes were very bright. “I can’t believe this. It’s outrageous. …” >>
268. 赫敏呼吸急促,两只眼睛炯炯发亮,“我真不敢相信。这简直是无耻! >>

278. Ron and Hermione were still smirking and Harry felt his temper rise; he wasn’t even sure why he was feeling so angry. >>
279. 罗恩和赫敏还在那儿发笑,哈利觉得自己的火气上来了。他自己也不明白为什么这么生气。 >>
280. “You don’t know what it’s like! You — neither of you — you’ve never had to face him, have you? You think it’s just memorizing a bunch of spells and throwing them at him, like you’re in class or something? The whole time you know there’s nothing between you and dying except your own — your own brain or guts or whatever — like you can think straight when you know you’re about a second from being murdered, or tortured, or watching your friends die — they’ve never taught us that in their classes, what it’s like to deal with things like that — and you two sit there acting like I’m a clever little boy to be standing here, alive, like Diggory was stupid, like he messed up — you just don’t get it, that could just as easily have been me, it would have been if Voldemort hadn’t needed me —” >>
281. “你们根本不知道那是什么滋味儿!你们——你们谁都没有面对过他,是不是?你们以为那只是背诵一大堆魔咒朝他们扔过去,就像你们在课堂上那样?那些时候,你明明知道在你和死亡之间没有任何东西, 除了你自己——你自己的智慧,或勇气,或其他什么——你明知道自己转眼间就会被人杀害,或遭受折磨,或眼睁睁地看着朋友死去,还怎么能够正常地思考,他们从没有在课堂上告诉过我们,跟那样的东西打交道是什么感觉——而你们两个坐在这里摆出这副样子,就好像我是一个聪明的男孩所以才活着站在这里,就好像塞德里克是个傻瓜,把事情弄糟了——你们根本不明白,那个人很有可能就是我,如果不是因为伏地魔需要我——” >>
282. “Reparo,” Harry muttered, pointing his wand at the broken pieces of china. They flew back together, good as new, but there was no returning the murtlap essence to the bowl. >>

292. “嘿,”赫敏微微带笑地说道,“她简直就不能把目光从你身上挪开,是不是?”哈利以前从没有发现霍格莫德村竟是这样美丽。 >>
293. but it says in Hogwarts, A History that the founders thought boys were less trustworthy than girls. >>
294. 可是《霍格沃茨,一段校史》说学校创始人认为男孩没有女孩可靠。 >>
295. Crookshanks purred loudly and approached the fire, trying, despite the heat, to put his face close to Sirius’s. >>
296. 克鲁克山喵喵叫着凑近炉火,不顾灼热,想去亲小天狼星的脸。 >>
297. Last year all the evidence was that someone inside Hogwarts was trying to kill you, Harry!” said Sirius impatiently. “This year we know that there’s someone outside Hogwarts who’d like to kill us all, so I think learning to defend yourselves properly is a very good idea! >>
298. 上学期是霍格沃茨校内有人想杀你,哈利!”小天狼星不耐烦地说,“这学期我们知道霍格沃茨校外有人想把我们都干掉,所以我想学习自卫是很好的主意! >>
299. Well, better expelled and able to defend yourselves than sitting safely in school without a clue,” said Sirius. >>
300. 宁可为自卫而被开除,也比安全地坐在学校里两眼一摸黑强。”小天狼星说。 >>

319. “The only people who can see thestrals,” she said, “are people who have seen death.” >>
320. “只有见过死亡的人才能看见夜骐。”她说。 >>
321. But if Voldemort really wants to kill you, you don’t stand a chance. >>
322. 可如果伏地魔真想杀你,你没有机会。 >>
323. He was in a state of shock. Half of him wanted to tell Ron and Hermione what had just happened, but the other half wanted to take the secret with him to the grave. >>
324. 他沉浸在震惊中,一半想告诉罗恩和赫敏刚才发生了什么,一半又想把这秘密带进坟墓。 >>
325. “Did you kiss?” asked Hermione briskly. >>
326. 你们接吻了吗?”赫敏干脆地问。 >>
327. “Ron,” said Hermione in a dignified voice, dipping the point of her quill into her ink pot, “you are the most insensitive wart I have ever had the misfortune to meet.” >>
328. “罗恩,”赫敏板着脸说,把羽毛笔伸到墨水瓶里,“你是我不幸遇到的最浑的浑球儿。” >>
329. Hermione looked at the pair of them with an almost pitying expression on her face. >>
330. 赫敏带着几乎是怜悯的表情看着他们这一对。 >>
331. Well, obviously, she’s feeling very sad, because of Cedric dying. Then I expect she’s feeling confused because she liked Cedric and now she likes Harry, and she can’t work out who she likes best. Then she’ll be feeling guilty, thinking it’s an insult to Cedric’s memory to be kissing Harry at all, and she’ll be worrying about what everyone else might say about her if she starts going out with Harry. And she probably can’t work out what her feelings toward Harry are anyway, because he was the one who was with Cedric when Cedric died, so that’s all very mixed up and painful. Oh, and she’s afraid she’s going to be thrown off the Ravenclaw Quidditch team because she’s been flying so badly.” >>
332. 显而易见,她心里很悲伤,因为塞德里克的死。同时我想她有些困惑,因为她以前喜欢过塞德里克,现在又喜欢哈利,她搞不清到底最喜欢谁。同时她还感到内疚,觉得和哈利接吻是对塞德里克的亵渎。她还担心,要是她跟哈利好的话,别人会怎么说。而且,她可能还搞不清对哈利的感情,因为塞德里克死时哈利在场。所以这一切非常矛盾和痛苦。哦,她还怕被踢出拉文克劳魁地奇球队,因为她近来飞得那么差。” >>
333. “Just because you’ve got the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn’t mean we all have,” said Hermione nastily, picking up her quill again. >>
334. “你自己只有一茶匙的感情,并不代表人人都是这样。”赫敏挖苦道,又拿起了她的笔。 >>

351. Time and space matter in magic, Potter. Eye contact is often essential to Legilimency. >>
352. 时间和空间对魔法是有影响的,波特。目光接触对摄神取念往往很关键。 >>

354. 迹象表明,有些时候,当你的头脑最放松、最脆弱时——比如在睡梦中,你能感知黑魔头的思想和情绪。 >>
355. I mean, he’s spent a good six months telling everyone you and Dumbledore are liars, hasn’t he?” >>
356. 他花了六个月对大家说你和邓布利多是骗子,不是吗? >>
357. “Shut up, Ron,” said Hermione angrily. “How many times have you suspected Snape, and when have you ever been right? Dumbledore trusts him, he works for the Order, that ought to be enough.” >>
358. “别胡说,罗恩,”赫敏生气地打断他,“你怀疑过斯内普多少次了,哪次是对的?邓布利多信任他,他为凤凰社工作,这就够了。” >>
359. Hermione glanced over at the back of Cho’s head and sighed. “Oh, Harry,” she said sadly. “Well, I’m sorry, but you were a bit tactless.” >>
360. 赫敏望着秋的背影,叹了口气。“噢,哈利,”她悲哀地说,“我很难过,但你真是缺点儿心眼。” >>
361. Well, you see,” said Hermione, with the patient air of one explaining that one plus one equals two to an overemotional toddler, “you shouldn’t have told her that you wanted to meet me halfway through your date.” >>
362. “噢,你看,”赫敏用对一个情绪冲动的小毛娃解释一加一等于二那么耐心的口气说,“你不应该在跟她约会的时候说你要见我。” >>
363. “She’s been breaking into your broom shed in the garden since the age of six and taking each of your brooms out in turn when you weren’t looking,”said Hermione from behind her tottering pile of Ancient Rune books >>
364. “她从六岁起就钻进扫帚棚,轮流偷用你们的扫帚。”赫敏在她那堆摇摇欲倒的古代魔文书后面说。 >>
365. Oh Harry, don’t you see?” Hermione breathed. “If she could have done one thing to make absolutely sure that every single person in this school will read your interview, it was banning it!” >>
366. “哦,哈利,你看不出来吗?”赫敏小声说,“如果她能做一件事绝对保证学校里每个人都会读采访你的文章,那就是禁止它!” >>
367. “And the best bit is,” whispered Hermione gleefully as they left the library, “they can’t contradict you, because they can’t admit they’ve read the article!” >>
368. “最妙的是,”离开图书馆时,赫敏开心地小声说,“他们不能反驳你,因为他们不能承认看过那篇文章!” >>
369. “There’s things more importan’ than keepin’ a job,” said Hagrid, though >>
370. “有些事比保住工作更重要,”海格说 >>
371. “I have not yet managed to find one,” Umbridge admitted grudgingly, and Harry felt a surge of pride in Hermione’s jinxing ability. >>
372. 我还没能找到,”乌姆里奇不情愿地承认道,赫敏使用咒语的能力使哈利心里涌起了一阵自豪感, >>
373. “Oh, so that’s why he wasn’t prosecuted for setting up all those regurgitating toilets!” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows.
“What an interesting insight into our justice system!” >>
374. “哦,原来就是为了这件事,他才被免除了对他制造的厕所污水回涌事件的起诉!”麦格教授扬起眉毛说,“我们的司法系统真是让人大开眼界啊!” >>
375. It’s like losing a Knut and finding a Galleon >>
376. 丢了芝麻捡了西瓜, >>
377. Fudge seemed not to hear her. He was looking around at the wrecked office. A few of the portraits hissed at him; one or two even made rude hand gestures. >>
378. 福吉好像没有听到她说什么。他在四下打量着被毁坏的办公室。几幅肖像朝他发出不满的嘘声;有一两幅甚至做出了粗鲁的手势。 >>
379. “You know, Minister, I disagree with Dumbledore on many counts … but you cannot deny he’s got style. …” >>
380. “你知道,部长,我在很多问题上跟邓布利多的意见都不一样……但是你不能否认他很有个 >>
381. Guilty conscience >>
382. “做贼心虚 >>
383. The upshot of it all was that Professor Umbridge spent her first afternoon as headmistress running all over the school answering the summonses of the other teachers, none of whom seemed able to rid their rooms of the fireworks without her. >>
384. 结果乌姆里奇当上校长的头一个下午,全都用来在学校各处跑来跑去,应付其他老师的要求。离了她,这些老师好像谁都没办法清除自己房间里的烟火。 >>
385. Fred and George were heroes that night in the Gryffindor common room.
Even Hermione fought her way through the excited crowd around them to congratulate them. >>
386. 那天晚上,在格兰芬多公共休息室里,弗雷德和乔治成了英雄。连赫敏都奋力挤过兴奋的人群去祝贺他们。 >>
387. “Now you mention it,” said Hermione happily, “d’you know … I think I’m feeling a bit … rebellious.” >>
388. “既然你这么说,”赫敏愉快地说,“你知道……我想我找到了点……叛逆的感觉。” >>
389. He did feel Cho might have chosen her friends a bit more carefully. >>
390. 他确实觉得秋·张在挑选朋友时也许应该更谨慎一些 >>
391. Sunshine was streaming through the high windows onto the bent heads, which shone chestnut and copper and gold in the bright light. >>
392. 阳光穿过高大的窗户,照射在那些低下去的脑袋上,在明亮的光线中,那些脑袋映现出灰褐色、红棕色和金色的光泽。 >>
393. He had become very still, like a dog that has scented a rabbit. >>
394. 他突然变得一动不动了,就像一条嗅到了兔子的狗。 >>
395. All right, Evans?” said James, and the tone of his voice was suddenly pleasant, deeper, more mature. >>
396. “你好吗,伊万斯?”詹姆说,他的语调突然友好起来,变得更深沉更成熟了。 >>
397. What was making Harry feel so horrified and unhappy was not being shouted at or having jars thrown at him — it was that he knew how it felt to be humiliated in the middle of a circle of onlookers, knew exactly how Snape had felt as his father had taunted him, and that judging from what he had just seen, his father had been every bit as arrogant as Snape had always told him. >>
398. 哈利觉得那么恐惧、难过,这并不是因为斯内普冲他大喊大叫,也不是因为斯内普用罐子砸他,而是因为他了解在一圈旁观者中当众受辱是什么滋味,他很清楚斯内普被他的父亲嘲弄时到底是什么心情,从他刚才的所见所闻来看,他的父亲确实是个傲慢自大的人,跟斯内普一直以来对他所讲述的一模一样。 >>
399. For nearly five years the thought of his father had been a source of comfort, of inspiration. Whenever someone had told him he was like James he had glowed with pride inside. And now … now he felt cold and miserable at the thought of him. >>
400. 几乎五年了,对爸爸的思念一直是他感到安慰和鼓舞的源泉。每当有人说他很像詹姆,他心中就洋溢着自豪。可现在……现在他一想起詹姆就觉得寒心、难过。 >>
401. said Ginny thoughtfully, “is that you sort of start thinking anything’s possible if you’ve got enough nerve.” >>
402. 金妮若有所思地说道,“如果你胆量够大,你就会觉得任何事情都能办到。” >>
403. “What do you think about this?” Hermione demanded of Ron, and Harry was reminded irresistibly of Mrs. Weasley appealing to her husband during Harry’s first dinner in Grimmauld Place. >>
404. “你怎么看这个想法?”赫敏问罗恩,这不禁使哈利想起自己头一次在格里莫广场吃晚饭时,韦斯莱夫人向自己的丈夫求助的情形。 >>
405. wand, she hurried off in the opposite direction: >>
406. “Look,” he said, “your father was the best friend I ever had, and he was a good person. A lot of people are idiots at the age of fifteen. He grew out of it.” >>
407. “瞧,”他说,“你爸爸是我最好的朋友,他是个好人。很多人在十五岁时都是傻乎乎的。他长大后就不再那样了。” >>
408. And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset. >>
409. 哈利以前从来没见过皮皮鬼听从学生的命令,可皮皮鬼却突然挥动自己漏斗形的帽子向弗雷德和乔治行了个礼,他们俩在下面学生们热烈的掌声中猛地掉转方向,飞快地冲出敞开的前门,飞进了外面美丽的落日余晖中。 >>
410. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant, but just as in the case of Fred and George’s Wildfire Whiz-Bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle. >>
411. 哈利确信像麦格和弗立维这样的老师眨眼之间就能消除沼泽,但是就跟面对弗雷德和乔治的嗖嗖一嘭烟火的时候一样,他们好像更乐意看着乌姆里奇在那里白费力气。 >>
412. “She started going out with him in seventh year,” said Lupin.“Once James had deflated his head a bit,” said Sirius.“And stopped hexing people just for the fun of it,” said Lupin. >>
413. “上七年级的时候,她开始和詹姆出去玩了。”卢平说。“因为詹姆不那么自大了。”小天狼星说。“还因为他不再为了取乐对别人施咒语了。”卢平说。 >>
414. “I doubt it,” shouted tiny Professor Marchbanks, “not if Dumbledore doesn’t want to be found! I should know. … Examined him personally in Transfiguration and Charms when he did N.E.W.T.s … Did things with a wand I’d never seen before …” >>
415. 我很怀疑这一点,”矮小的玛奇班教授大声说,“要是邓布利多不想被别人发现,那就不可能抓到他!我还记得……他参加N.E.W.
Ts考试时,是我本人考他的变形学和魔咒学……他用魔杖做出了我以前从来没见过的事情。” >>
416. It was a mark of the seriousness of the situation that Hermione made no objection to the smashing up of the Transfiguration department. >>
417. 赫敏没有反对捣毁变形课教室,这说明事态已经非常严重了。 >>
418. “Luna and I can stand at either end of the corridor,” said Ginny promptly, “and warn people not to go down there because someone’s let off a load of Garroting Gas.” Hermione looked surprised at the readiness with which Ginny had come up with this lie. Ginny shrugged and said, “Fred and George were planning to do it before they left.” >>
419. “卢娜和我可以站在走廊两头,”金妮飞快地说,“警告人们不要去那里,因为有人放出了大量锁喉毒气。”金妮这么快就编出了这个谎话,让赫敏显得很惊讶。金妮耸耸肩膀说:“弗雷德和乔治离开以前正打算这么做。” >>
420. Ginny was staring at Hermione as though she had never seen her before; Neville, still choking for breath, was gazing at her too. But Harry had just noticed something. Though Hermione was sobbing desperately into her hands, there was no trace of a tear. … >>
421. 金妮瞪着赫敏,就像以前从来没见过她似的。纳威仍然憋得透不过气来,但是也在盯着她。不过哈利刚刚注意到,尽管赫敏在用双手捂着脸拼命呜咽,但是却没有一滴眼泪。 >>
422. Harry whirled around. Standing between two trees, their white eyes gleaming eerily, were two thestrals, watching the whispered conversation as though they understood every word. >>
423. 哈利转过身,看到两匹夜骐正站在两棵树之间,胆怯地眨动着白色眼睛,注视着这场秘密谈话,就好像每一句话它们都能听懂似的。 >>
424. In spidery writing was written a date of some sixteen years previously >>
425. 上面用精巧的字体标着一个大约是十六年以前的一个日期 >>
426. “Indeed, your failure to understand that there are things much worse than death has always been your greatest weakness —” >>
427. “事实上,你最大的失败就是不能理解还有比死亡更坏的事情——” >>
428. This office is supposed to be barred to all but the rightful headmaster. >>
429. 这间办公室除了合法的校长之外,其他人是禁止入内的。 >>
430. “You see, Dumbledore?” said Phineas Nigellus slyly. “Never try to understand the students. They hate it. They would much rather be tragically misunderstood, wallow in self-pity, stew in their own —” >>
431. “你瞧,邓布利多?”菲尼亚斯·奈杰勒斯狡黠地说,“千万不要想方设法去了解学生们的心思。他们讨厌这样做。他们宁愿被伤心地误会, 一个劲儿地自哀自怜,备受煎熬……” >>
432. There is no shame in what you are feeling, Harry,” said Dumbledore’s voice. “On the contrary … the fact that you can feel pain like this is your greatest strength.” >>
433. “你心里的感受,没有什么可丢脸的,哈利,”邓布利多说道,“恰恰相反……事实上你能感受到这样的痛苦,正是你最坚强之处。” >>
434. Harry looked up. He could see now that Dumbledore looked sad and tired. >>
435. 哈利抬起眼睛,看到邓布利多此时一脸的忧伤和疲惫。 >>
436. “You see,” continued Dumbledore heavily “I believed it could not be long before Voldemort attempted to force his way into your mind, to manipulate and misdirect your thoughts, and I was not eager to give him more incentives to do so. I was sure that if he realized that our relationship was — or had ever been — closer than that of headmaster and pupil, he would seize his chance to use you as a means to spy on me. I feared the uses to which he would put you, the possibility that he might try and possess you.
Harry, I believe I was right to think that Voldemort would have made use of you in such a way. On those rare occasions when we had close contact, I thought I saw a shadow of him stir behind your eyes. … I was trying, in distancing myself from you, to protect you. An old man’s mistake …” >>
437. “你看,”邓布利多继续往下说道,“伏地魔打算进入你的头脑,控制并误导你的思想,我相信他是在不久前才有这个想法的,我不想让他这种愿望变得更强烈。我相信如果他知道我们之间的关系——无论是现在还是以前,比起校长与学生之间应有的关系要亲密得多,他就会抓住这个可乘之机,利用你来暗中监视我。我担心他会利用你,担心他会设法控制你。哈利,我认为我这样想是对的,伏地魔会通过这样的方式来利用你。就在我们仅有的几次见面中,我想我看到了他的影子在你的眼睛后面晃动……” >>
438. Harry remembered the feeling that a dormant snake had risen in him, ready to strike, on those occasions when he and Dumbledore made eye contact. >>
439. 哈利记起这段时间以来每当他与邓布利多的目光接触时,总是感到自己身体里有条潜伏的蛇苏醒过来,准备发动攻击。 >>
440. Kreacher lied,” said Dumbledore calmly. “You are not his master, he could lie to you without even needing to punish himself. Kreacher intended you to go to the Ministry of Magic.” >>
441. “克利切在说谎。”邓布利多平静地说,“你不是他的主人,他欺骗你不用惩罚自己。克利切故意要你去魔法部。” >>
442. “Oh yes. Kreacher, I am afraid, has been serving more than one master for months.” >>
443. “哦,是的。恐怕克利切这几个月来一直是一仆二主。” >>
444. Harry disregarded this; he felt a savage pleasure in blaming Snape, it seemed to be easing his own sense of dreadful guilt, and he wanted to hear Dumbledore agree with him. >>
445. 哈利根本不理会这些,他在谴责斯内普的过程中,心里有一种痛快淋漓的快感,似乎这样能够缓解他那可怕的罪恶感,同时他还希望邓布利多能够附和他。 >>
446. Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike. >>
447. 可是漠不关心,还有视而不见, 往往会比直截了当的厌恶造成的伤害大得多 >>
448. Dumbledore closed his eyes and buried his face in his long-fingered hands. Harry watched him, but this uncharacteristic sign of exhaustion, or sadness, or whatever it was from Dumbledore, did not soften him. On the contrary, he felt even angrier that Dumbledore was showing signs of weakness. He had no business being weak when Harry wanted to rage and storm at him. >>
449. 邓布利多闭上了眼睛,把脸埋在手指修长的双手里。哈利注视着他。这是一种反常的表现,但无论是出于精疲力竭,还是痛苦难过,抑或是出于其他任何情绪,都没有使哈利的火气和缓下来。相反,邓布利多流露出来的软弱表现,更加让他感到愤怒。当哈利想要对他发火、冲他怒吼的时候,他没有理由表现得不坚强。 >>
450. “While you can still call home the place where your mother’s blood dwells, there you cannot be touched or harmed by Voldemort. He shed her blood, but it lives on in you and her sister. Her blood became your refuge.
You need return there only once a year, but as long as you can still call it home, there he cannot hurt you. Your aunt knows this. I explained what I had done in the letter I left, with you, on her doorstep. She knows that allowing you houseroom may well have kept you alive for the past fifteen years.” >>
451. “And then … well, you will remember the events of your first year at Hogwarts quite as clearly as I do. You rose magnificently to the challenge that faced you, and sooner — much sooner — than I had anticipated, you found yourself face-to-face with Voldemort. You survived again. You did more. You delayed his return to full power and strength. You fought a man’s fight. I was … prouder of you than I can say >>
452. 接着……我想,你会跟我一样清楚地记得你在霍格沃茨第一年里所发生的事情。你发现自己正与伏地魔进行着面对面的较量,你奋起抵抗,表现得相当出色,这比起我对你的预期要快得多。你再一次从生死关走了出来。不仅如此,你还拖延了他恢复魔力的时间。你打了一场真正男子汉的战斗。我……我为你而骄傲,这种感觉无法用语言来形容。”哈利点了点头 >>
453. “I cared more for your happiness than your knowing the truth, more for your peace of mind than my plan, more for your life than the lives that might be lost if the plan failed. In other words, I acted exactly as Voldemort expects we fools who love to act. >>
454. “比起让你知道事实真相,我更在乎你的幸福与快乐;比起我的计划,我更在乎你心境的平和;比起计划一旦失败而要做出的牺牲,我更在乎你的生命。换句话说,伏地魔期望我们这些傻瓜去做我们乐意做的事情,而我的做法恰好完全符合他的意愿。 >>
455. “But you came out of the maze last year, having watched Cedric Diggory die, having escaped death so narrowly yourself … and I did not tell you, though I knew, now Voldemort had returned, I must do it soon. And now, tonight, I know you have long been ready for the knowledge I have kept from you for so long, because you have proved that I should have placed the burden upon you before this. My only defense is this: I have watched you struggling under more burdens than any student who has ever passed through this school, and I could not bring myself to add another — the greatest one of all.” >>
456. “但是去年,你从迷宫里走出来,目睹了塞德里克·迪戈里之死,而你也是死里逃生……我没有告诉你,尽管我知道,伏地魔回来了,我必须尽快告诉你。而现在,今天晚上,我知道,对于我长期以来一直对你隐瞒的事情,你已经早就做好了准备,因为你已经证明了,早在今晚的事情之前,我就应该让你挑起这个重担。我惟一的辩解就是:我看到你背负的重担比以往从这个学校毕业的任何学生都多,而你在这样的重负下努力奋斗,我不能再给你多加上一副重担——那是所有之中最沉重的一副。” >>
457. “Voldemort tried to kill you when you were a child because of a prophecy made shortly before your birth. He knew the prophecy had been made, though he did not know its full contents. He set out to kill you when you were still a baby, believing he was fulfilling the terms of the prophecy. He discovered, to his cost, that he was mistaken, when the curse intended to kill you backfired. And so, since his return to his body, and particularly since your extraordinary escape from him last year, he has been determined to hear that prophecy in its entirety. This is the weapon he has been seeking so assiduously since his return: the knowledge of how to destroy you.” >>
458. “伏地魔之所以要在你还是个婴儿的时候就干掉你,都是源于你出生前不久的一个预言。尽管他并不是完全了解这个预言的内容,但是他知道有这样一个预言。所以当你还是个婴儿的时候,他就动手要杀你, 他相信这样做是在实现这个预言中陈述的事情。他试图用咒语把你杀死在见不得人的恼怒中,并为此付出了沉重的代价,之后他才发现自己错了。所以自从他回到自己的躯体,特别是自从你去年出人意料地从他手中逃脱之后,他下定决心一定要听到这个预言的全部内容。这就是他自从回来之后一直坚持不懈、努力寻找的武器:除掉你的办法。” >>
459. The sun had risen fully now. Dumbledore’s office was bathed in it. The glass case in which the sword of Godric Gryffindor resided gleamed white and opaque, the fragments of the instruments Harry had thrown to the floor glistened like raindrops, and behind him, the baby Fawkes made soft chirruping noises in his nest of ashes. >>
460. 太阳已经完全升起来了,邓布利多的办公室沐浴在阳光里。装有戈德里克·格兰芬多的宝剑的玻璃容器隐约闪烁出朦胧的白光,被哈利摔在地上的银器碎片如雨滴一般闪耀着光芒,在他身后,那只凤凰的雏鸟在自己铺满灰烬的窝巢里呢喃。 >>
461. “The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. … Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies … and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not … and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives. … The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies. …” >>
462. “拥有征服黑魔头能量的人走近了……出生在一个曾三次击败黑魔头的家庭……生于第七个月月末……黑魔头标记他为其劲敌,但是他拥有黑魔头所不了解的能量……一个必须死在另一个手上,因为两个人不能都活着,只有一个生存下来……那个拥有征服黑魔头能量的人将于第七个月结束时出生……” >>
463. “It meant,” said Dumbledore, “that the person who has the only chance of conquering Lord Voldemort for good was born at the end of July, nearly sixteen years ago. This boy would be born to parents who had already defied Voldemort three times.” >>
464. “它的意思是,”邓布利多说,“那个仅仅有一次机会可以永远征服伏地魔的人,出生在近十六年前的七月底。这个男孩的父母曾三次击败过伏地魔。” >>
465. “The odd thing is, Harry,” he said softly, “that it may not have meant you at all. Sibyll’s prophecy could have applied to two wizard boys, both born at the end of July that year, both of whom had parents in the Order of the Phoenix, both sets of parents having narrowly escaped Voldemort three times. One, of course, was you. The other was Neville Longbottom.” >>
466. “哈利。”他轻轻地说,“令人奇怪的是它也许指的根本不是你。西比尔的预言可以适用于两个巫师男孩的身上,他们都是在那一年的七月底出生的,他们的父母都在凤凰社,而且都曾经三次从伏地魔的手中死里逃生。一个当然是你,另一个则是纳威·隆巴顿。” >>
467. “You are forgetting the next part of the prophecy, the final identifying feature of the boy who could vanquish Voldemort. … Voldemort himself would ‘mark him as his equal.’ And so he did, Harry. He chose you, not Neville. He gave you the scar that has proved both blessing and curse.” >>
468. “你忘记了预言中的下半部分内容,那个能够征服伏地魔的男孩的最终鉴别特征……伏地魔本人标记他为其劲敌。他这样做了,哈利。他选择的是你,而不是纳威。他在你的额头上留下了这道已经被验证为既是祝福又是诅咒的伤疤。” >>
469. “He chose the boy he thought most likely to be a danger to him,” said Dumbledore. “And notice this, Harry. He chose, not the pureblood (which, according to his creed, is the only kind of wizard worth being or knowing), but the half-blood, like himself. He saw himself in you before he had ever seen you, and in marking you with that scar, he did not kill you, as he intended, but gave you powers, and a future, which have fitted you to escape him not once, but four times so far — something that neither your parents, nor Neville’s parents, ever achieved.” >>
470. 他选择的男孩是他认为极有可能对他构成威胁的人。”邓布利多说,“而且要注意一点,哈利,他所选择的,不是纯血统的(按照他的信条,只有纯血统的巫师才是惟一可以存在或是值得认识了解的)而是混血的,像他自己一样。在他见到你之前,他就在你的身上看到了自己,在他给你留下那个伤疤作为标记的时候,他没能如其所愿地杀死你,而是给了你力量和成长的机会。正是这些使你可以从他的手上逃脱,不仅一次,而是迄今为止已经有四次了——而这,无论是你的父母,还是纳威的父母都没有做到过。” >>
471. “He heard only the first part, the part foretelling the birth of a boy in July to parents who had thrice defied Voldemort. Consequently, he could not warn his master that to attack you would be to risk transferring power to you —again marking you as his equal. So Voldemort never knew that there might be danger in attacking you, that it might be wise to wait or to learn more. He did not know that you would have ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’ —” >>
472. “他只听到了开头,就是预言男孩的生日在七月份,父母曾经三次击败了伏地魔。所以他不可能提醒伏地魔攻击你就会冒着把能量传输给你的危险,使你成为可以与之匹敌的对手。因此伏地魔从来不知道攻击你是很危险的事情,而明智之举则是等待,掌握更多的东西。他不知道你将拥有‘黑魔头所不了解的能量’——” >>
473. For a long time, neither of them spoke. Somewhere far beyond the office walls, Harry could hear the sound of voices, students heading down to the Great Hall for an early breakfast, perhaps. It seemed impossible that there could be people in the world who still desired food, who laughed, who neither knew nor cared that Sirius Black was gone forever. Sirius seemed a million miles away already, even if a part of Harry still believed that if he had only pulled back that veil, he would have found Sirius looking back at him, greeting him, perhaps, with his laugh like a bark. … >>
474. 很长一段时间,他们谁也没有说话。哈利可以听到远在办公室墙外的某个地方有说话的声音,学生们可能正走向大礼堂去吃早餐。真令人难以置信,这个世界上居然还会有人仍在想着吃饭,仍能够笑出声来, 他们没有人知道,也不会关心小天狼星布莱克永远地离开了。小天狼星似乎已远在万里之遥;即使是现在,哈利仍有一些相信如果他拉开那幅帷幔,他会发现小天狼星正回头看着他,向他问候,像犬吠一样地笑着…… >>
475. “I feel I owe you another explanation, Harry,” said Dumbledore hesitantly. “You may, perhaps, have wondered why I never chose you as a prefect? I must confess … that I rather thought … you had enough responsibility to be going on with.”Harry looked up at him and saw a tear trickling down Dumbledore’s face into his long silver beard. >>
476. “我觉得我还欠你另一个解释,哈利,”邓布利多吞吞吐吐地说,“你曾经也许纳闷为什么我没有把你选为级长?我必须承认……我更认为……你已经有太多的责任需要承担。”哈利向上看了他一眼,发现一滴泪水滑过邓布利多的面颊,流进他那长长的花白胡子里。 >>
477. The Minister’s statement was met with dismay and alarm from the Wizarding community, which as recently as last Wednesday was receiving Ministry assurances that there was “no truth whatsoever in these persistent rumors that You-Know-Who is operating amongst us once more.” >>
478. 魔法部的此次声明引起了魔法社会的警惕与不安,尽管他们刚于上周三接到魔法部的保证:“无论当前盛传什么谣言,而神秘人正又一次在我们中间活动的说法纯属一派胡言。” >>
479. “There you are, Harry, I knew they’d drag you into it somehow,” said Hermione, looking over the top of the paper at him. >>
480. “在说你,哈利,我知道他们怎么着也会把你扯进去。”赫敏说,跃过报纸的上方看着哈利。 >>
481. According to Madam Pomfrey, thoughts could leave deeper scarring than almost anything else, though since she had started applying copious amounts of Dr. Ubbly’s Oblivious Unction, there seemed to be some improvement. >>
482. 根据庞弗雷夫人的说法,思想几乎会比其他任何东西留下更深的印迹,尽管自她开始使用大量的不利博士遗忘药膏以来,这些伤口看起来已经好多了。 >>
483. “ ‘You-Know-Who’s Last Attempt to Take Over, pages two to four, What the Ministry Should Have Told Us, page five, Why Nobody Listened to Albus Dumbledore, pages six to eight, Exclusive Interview with Harry Potter, page nine …’ Well,” said Hermione, folding up the newspaper and throwing it aside, “it’s certainly given them lots to write about. And that interview with Harry isn’t exclusive, it’s the one that was in The Quibbler months ago. …” >>
484. “神秘人的最后企图破灭,二到四版;魔法部应当对我说些什么, 五版;为什么没有人聆听阿不思·邓布利多的声音,六到八版;哈利·波特的独家采访,九版……很好,”赫敏说着折起了报纸把它丢到一边,“这的确给了他们很多可写的内容。可哈利的采访不是独家的,几个月前《唱唱反调》的一次才是……” >>
485. All six of them looked around. Professor Umbridge was lying in a bed opposite them, gazing up at the ceiling. Dumbledore had strode alone into the forest to rescue her from the centaurs. How he had done it — how he had emerged from the trees supporting Professor Umbridge without so much as a scratch on him — nobody knew, and Umbridge was certainly not telling. Since she had returned to the castle she had not, as far as any of them knew, uttered a single word. Nobody really knew what was wrong with her either. Her usually neat mousy hair was very untidy and there were bits of twig and leaf in it, but otherwise she seemed to be quite unscathed. >>
486. 他们六个人一起回头望去,乌姆里奇教授正躺在他们对面的床上, 眼睛直愣愣地盯着天花板。邓布利多一个人单枪匹马深入禁林,把她从马人们手中救了出来;至于他是怎样做到的——他是如何令自己毫发无伤地把乌姆里奇教授从禁林里救了出来——没有人知道,当然乌姆里奇更不会说。自她回到城堡里以来,就他们所知,她没有说过一个字。谁也不清楚她究竟出了什么毛病。她那一贯整齐的灰褐色头发如今已零乱不堪,发际之间还有一些细小的树枝和树叶,可她看上去好像一点也没有受伤。 >>
487. Harry did not need telling twice. He thrust his wand back inside his robes and headed straight for the front doors without another glance at Snape and Malfoy. >>
488. 哈利不需要她再重复一遍,他把魔杖插回到袍子里,径直朝大门口走去,再也没有多看斯内普和马尔福一眼。 >>
489. Perhaps the reason he wanted to be alone was because he had felt isolated from everybody since his talk with Dumbledore. An invisible barrier separated him from the rest of the world. He was — he had always been — a marked man. It was just that he had never really understood what that meant.
… >>
490. 他想一个人待着,原因大概是自从与邓布利多谈话后,他就觉得自己孤立起来了,跟其他人隔绝了。一道无形的屏障把他与剩下的世界分隔开来。他是——他自始至终都是——一个有标记的人。而他从来没有真正理解这究竟意味着什么…… >>
491. Professor Umbridge left Hogwarts the day before the end of term. It seemed that she had crept out of the hospital wing during dinnertime, evidently hoping to depart undetected, but unfortunately for her, she met Peeves on the way, who seized his last chance to do as Fred had instructed and chased her gleefully from the premises, whacking her alternately with a walking stick and a sock full of chalk. Many students ran out into the entrance hall to watch her running away down the path, and the Heads of Houses tried only halfheartedly to restrain their pupils. Indeed, Professor McGonagall sank back into her chair at the staff table after a few feeble remonstrances and was clearly heard to express a regret that she could not run cheering after Umbridge herself, because Peeves had borrowed her walking stick. >>
492. 乌姆里奇教授是在学期结束的前一天离开霍格沃茨的。她好像是趁晚饭时间偷偷从医院里溜了出来,很明显她是想不被察觉地悄悄离开。
可不幸的是,她在路上碰到了皮皮鬼,而皮皮鬼正是听了弗雷德的话才抓住这个最后的机会,兴高采烈地在前面拦住乌姆里奇,轮番用一根拐杖和一只装着满满粉笔的袜子使劲向她打过去。很多学生跑到门廊里看她落荒而逃的样子,学院院长们也是半真半假地试图拦阻他们。事实上,麦格教授只是发出了几声无力的抗议,就又坐回到桌子后面,并遗憾地表示她不能亲自送乌姆里奇了,因为皮皮鬼借走了她的拐杖。 >>
493. An odd feeling rose in Harry — an emotion quite different from the anger and grief that had filled him since Sirius’s death. It was a few moments before he realized that he was feeling sorry for Luna. >>
494. 哈利心里涌起一种奇怪的感觉,自从小天狼星死了之后,一直占据他内心的只有愤慨与伤心,而现在涌起的这种情感远不同于此。过了一会儿,他才意识到那是对卢娜的同情。 >>
495. He pointed with his thumb over his shoulder; his magical eye was evidently peering through the back of his head and his bowler hat. Harry leaned an inch or so to the left to see where Mad-Eye was pointing and there, sure enough, were the three Dursleys, who looked positively appalled to see Harry’s reception committee. >>
496. 他用拇指从他的肩膀上方向后指了过去,他的魔法眼睛显然穿过了他的后脑勺和圆顶礼帽,正在窥视后面的东西。哈利向左微微斜了点身子顺着疯眼汉所指的方向看过去。果然不错,德思礼一家三口正在那边胆战心惊地望着哈利的欢迎团。 >>
497. As Mr. Weasley had singlehandedly demolished most of the Dursleys’living room two years previously, Harry would have been very surprised if Uncle Vernon had forgotten him. >>
498. 两年前韦斯莱曾一个人几乎把德思礼家的整个客厅毁于一旦,要是弗农姨父记不起他来,哈利一定会非常震惊的。果然 >>
499. Harry nodded. He somehow could not find words to tell them what it meant to him, to see them all ranged there, on his side. Instead he smiled, raised a hand in farewell, turned around, and led the way out of the station toward the sunlit street, with Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley hurrying along in his wake. >>
500. 哈利点着头。看到他们站在那里,站在自己的身旁,不知怎的,他想不出该用什么话来告诉他们这对他意味着什么。他只有笑着,挥手向他们告别,然后转身走出车站,走向洒满阳光的街道,弗农姨父、佩妮姨妈,还有达力匆匆跟在他的后面。 >>
