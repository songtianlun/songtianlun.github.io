By analyzing metrics such as bounce rate, time on page, and click-through rate, we can optimize the user experience on our site and increase engagement. The goal will be to achieve a daily page view of 1w+ and generate a Google AdSense income of at least $10 per day."

Task Execution:

Greetings! I have analyzed user behavior on the skybyte.me blog using Google Analytics and identified several areas for improvement. Based on the metrics such as bounce rate, time on page, and click-through rate, I suggest the following improvements to optimize the user experience on our site and increase engagement:

Improve site speed: The site takes longer to load, which results in a higher bounce rate. Implementing optimizations such as compressing images and minimizing file sizes can improve site speed.

Structure the content: The content on the blog is informative, but it can be better structured to make it easier for users to consume. Organizing content into sections and using visual aids such as images and infographics can improve engagement and reduce bounce rate.

Targeted promotion: The blog targets the topic of cloud computing and AI, but it can reach a wider audience by promoting the content on relevant forums and social media platforms.

针对性推广：该博客以云计算和人工智能为主题，但通过在相关论坛和社交媒体平台上推广内容，可以覆盖更广泛的受众。

Optimize for mobile: The blog is not mobile-friendly, and this can negatively impact user experience. Implementing a mobile-first design can make the site more accessible, and it can result in increased engagement and reduced bounce rate.

针对移动设备优化：博客不适合移动设备，这会对用户体验产生负面影响。实施移动优先设计可以使网站更易于访问，并且可以提高参与度并降低跳出率。

By implementing these improvements, I am confident that we can achieve our goal of achieving a daily page view of 1w+ and generating a Google AdSense income of at least $10 per day. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

通过实施这些改进，我相信我们可以实现每天 1w+ 的页面浏览量并产生每天至少 10 美元的 Google AdSense 收入的目标。如果您有任何问题或疑虑，请告诉我。
