1. I think I’d better do the actual stealing >>
2. 我们需要声东击西 >>
3. Fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faithful pets.” >>
4. 凤凰真是十分奇特迷人的生命。它们能携带极为沉重的东西，它们的眼泪具有疗伤的作用，而且它们还是特别忠诚的宠物。” >>
5. “Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned anything from him except not to set pixies loose.” >>
6. “像洛哈特那种教法，我看未必。”罗恩说，“除了不要把小精灵放出来，我没有从他那里学到任何东西。” >>
7. “Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. “When in doubt, go to the library.” >>
8. 因为这就是赫敏的作风，”罗恩说着，耸了耸肩膀，“一有疑问，就上图书馆。” >>
9. you will find that I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You will also find that help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.” >>
10. 只有当这里的人都背叛我的时候，我才算真正离开了这所学校。你们还会发现，在霍格沃茨，那些请求帮助的人总是能得到帮助的。” >>
11. Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken’s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and venomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. >>
12. 在我们国家，游荡着许多可怕的野兽和怪物，其中最离奇、最具有杀伤力的莫过于蛇怪，又被称为蛇王。这种蛇的体积可以变得十分巨大，通常能活好几百年，它是从一只公鸡蛋里、由一只癞蛤蟆孵出的。它杀人的方式十分惊人，除了它致命的毒牙外，蛇怪的瞪视也能致人死亡，任何人只要被它的目光盯住，就会立刻丧命。蜘蛛看到蛇怪就会逃跑，因为蛇怪是蜘蛛的死敌，而蛇怪只有听见公鸡的叫声才会仓皇逃命，因为公鸡的叫声对它来说也是致命的。 >>
13. Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. This was the worst he had ever felt. If only there was something they could do. Anything. >>
14. 哈利可以看见太阳红得像血一样，渐渐沉落到地平线以下。他心里从来没有像现在这样难过。哪怕他们能够做点什么也好啊，不管是什么。 >>
15. — I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the greatest sorcerer in the world!” >>
16. 我给自己想出了一个新的名字，我知道有朝一日，当我成为世界上最伟大的魔法师时，各地的巫师都不敢轻易说出这个名字！” >>
17. For a split second, both Harry and Riddle, wand still raised, stared at it. Then, without thinking, without considering, as though he had meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fang on the floor next to him and plunged it straight into the heart of the book. >>
18. 在那生死关头的一刹那，哈利，以及仍然举着魔杖的里德尔，眼睛都盯住了它。然后，哈利没有思考，也没有半点犹豫，好像他一直就打定主意要这么做似的，他一把抓起身边地上的蛇怪毒牙，径直把它插进了日记本的中心。 >>
19. Never trust anything that can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain. >>
20. 永远不要相信任何能够独立思考的东西，除非你看清了它把头脑藏在什么地方。 >>
21. Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our words >>
22. “这就说明，即使是我们中间最优秀的人，有时候也只能说话不算话了。” >>
23. It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, “because I asked not to go in Slytherin. …” >>
24. It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” >>
25. 哈利，表现我们真正的自我，是我们自己的选择，这比我们所具有的能力更重要。 >>
26. “Proud?” said Harry. “Are you crazy? All those times I could’ve died, and I didn’t manage it? They’ll be furious. …” >>
27. “骄傲？”哈利说道，“难道你糊涂了吗？他们如果听说我好多次都差点死掉，却居然都死里逃生了，他们肯定会气坏的……” >>
