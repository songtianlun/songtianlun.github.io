Much worse than that. You can exist without your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still working. But you’ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, no … anything. There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just — exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever … lost.”

“我不能，哈利，我还有四百二十二页要读呢！”赫敏说，她的声音听起来有一点儿歇斯底里。“再说……”她也往罗恩那边看，“他不要我参加。”

## 50.

Harry threw himself forward, took both hands off his broom. He knocked Malfoy’s arm out of the way and —“YES!”He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers. Then Wood was speeding toward him, half-blinded by tears; he seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his shoulder. Harry felt two large thumps as Fred and George hit them; then Angelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “We’ve won the Cup! We’ve won the Cup!” Tangled together in a many-armed hug, the Gryffindor team sank, yelling hoarsely, back to earth.

哈利全身向前扑去，两手都离开了飞天扫帚。他击开马尔福的胳膊，然而……“没错！”他停止了下冲，手举着，看台爆炸了。哈利飞在人群上方，耳朵里有一种奇特的响声。他紧握那只金色小球，那小球无望地在他手指缝里拍动着双翼。 然后伍德向他疾驶过来，泪水让他几乎看不见东西了，他抓住哈利的脖子，伏在他肩上肆无忌惮地抽泣起来。弗雷德和乔治撞上哈利，哈利觉得有两大块东西直压过来。然后是安吉利娜、艾丽娅和凯蒂的声音：“我们赢得奖杯了！我们赢得奖杯了！”格兰芬多队员相互搂抱在一起下降，叫得嗓子都哑了，就这样回到了地面。

## 51.

If only there had been a dementor around. … As a sobbing Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he lifted it into the air, Harry felt he could have produced the world’s best Patronus.

要是刚才有摄魂怪的话……哈利接过伍德抽泣着递给他的奖杯，把奖杯高高举起，觉得自己仿佛能够发出世界上最棒的守护神。

Trelawney had gone rigid in her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging.

## 54.

He looked like a man who did not know where he was or what to do. This helplessness was worse to watch than tears.

他看上去像是个不知道自己身在何地、也不知道自己该做什么的人。看见这种无助的情况要比看见流泪更糟。

## 55.

The seconds lengthened

这几秒钟很长，

## 56.

But he never finished the question, because what he saw made his voice die in his throat.

但他永远没能问完这个问题，因为他看见的景象让他的喉咙发不出声音了。

## 57.

It would have been impossible to say which face showed more hatred

这时，人们没法判断谁脸上露出的仇恨更深。

## 58.

Like father, like son,

有其父，必有其子

## 59.

Long time, no see

## 60.

Because you never did anything for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you.

“同有史以来最邪恶的魔头斗争有什么好处？”

## 62,

It was now or never.

要么就是现在，要么就永远做不到了。

## 63.

Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly. “He’s just suffered a severe disappointment.”

哦，他不是脑子不清楚，”邓布利多平静地说道，“只不过是极度失望罢了。

## 64.

It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your experience with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The consequences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that predicting the future is a very difficult business indeed. … Professor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. … You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.”

“不是的，”邓布利多平静地说，“用计时器的时候，你的经历没有教会你什么东西吗，哈利？我们行动的后果经常是如此复杂、如此分散，因此，预言未来的确是很困难的事……特里劳妮教授，上帝保佑她，就是活生生的例子。你救了小矮星彼得的命，你这是做了件很高尚的事。”

## 65.

This is magic at its deepest, its most impenetrable, Harry. But trust me … the time may come when you will be very glad you saved Pettigrew’s life.”

“这是魔法的最高、最无法参透的境界，哈利。但是相信我……有朝一日你会因为救过小矮星彼得的命而非常高兴的。

## 66.

Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “An extraordinary achievement — not least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most unusual form your Patronus took, when it charged Mr. Malfoy down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. You know, Harry, in a way, you did see your father last night. …You found him inside yourself.”

“昨晚小天狼星把他们如何成为阿尼马格斯的事情都告诉我了。”邓布利多微笑着说，“一项特殊的成就——不让我知道，做到这一点就不容易。那时我记起你的守护神呈现出来的最不平凡的形状，那是在你们和拉文克劳队进行魁地奇比赛中，你的守护神对着马尔福冲过去的时候。所以说，你昨晚的确看见你爸爸了，哈利……你在你身体里面发现了他。”
