Through the space database course was completed last semester. But to be honest, i am fail to understand what a space database is. Even though i have always claimed to be using a spatial database.

Actually, i am really using a spatial database ,but it was only used to store spatial data,but did not query.

Now, when i need to query the relationship between points in the coordinate system during the development process, i finally figured out what the value of the spatial database exists.

As stated in the quote above. A spatial database is a database that is optimized for storing and querying data that represents objects defined in a geometric space.

We use space database to store and query location-related data more efficiently, especially when it comes to analyzing relationships between large numbers of spatial objects.
