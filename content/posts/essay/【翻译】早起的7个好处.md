Title: **7 Benefits of Waking Up Early (That Have Nothing to Do With Being a CEO) **

中文翻译为博主自主翻译，若有不足之处，恳请在评论中指出。

# 原文

Ugh, another blog post on the benefits of waking up early. Don’t we already have enough of these?

Look, before we dive into the tips, let me start by saying this — you don’t have to wake up early. You’re not destined for failure if you wake up early. I’m not going to look down on your if you don’t wake up early.

That being said, there a ton of benefits of waking up early as long as you do it for the right reason.

[hint]
另一篇关于早起好处的博客文章，难道我们起的还不够早吗？

听着，在我们深入讨论技巧之前，让我们先谈谈这个——你不必早起。如果你早起，就不会一败涂地。但如果你不早起，我不会看不起你。

也就是说，早起有太多好处，前提是你有正确的理由。
[/hint]

## The Wrong Reason to Wake Up Early

I once wrote a post called The Secret to a Successful Morning Routine. In it, I discussed the number one reason people fail at waking up early.

Here’s an excerpt from it:

The most important component of creating a successful morning routine is actually having a real reason to get up in the first place.

[hint]
早起的错误理由

我曾经写过一篇名为《成功晨间作息的秘诀》的文章。文中我讨论了人们不能早起的首要原因。

可以这样解释：

创造一个成功晨间作息习惯的最重要组成部分实际上是有一个真正充分的理由，能让我们立刻早起的理由。
[/hint]

Waking up at 5 a.m. isn’t going to magically turn you into Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg. It’s a means to an end, not the end itself.

If you’re under the impression you need to wake up early because it causes success, think again.

Success comes from figuring out what your values are and aligning the things you do around those values.

[hint]
早上5点钟起床不会神奇地让你变成埃隆 · 马斯克 或 马克 · 扎克伯格。它是达到目的的一种手段，而不是目的本身。

如果在你的映像中，早起的原因是早起会造就成功。那我劝你还是再深入思考一下。

成功来自于清晰的价值观，并围绕这一价值观付出努力。
[/hint]

Having some vague reason to get up or reading that “successful people” and CEO’s do it won’t help you start a morning routine.

Once you realize that waking up early serves a purpose, you’ll treat it like a means to an end instead of the end itself. Then, you’ll actually stand a chance of making it a successful habit.

I wake up at 5 a.m. every weekday. To be honest, I don’t like doing it all that much. Waking up when it’s still dark out kind of sucks. I don’t totally hate it either, though.

[hint]
因为一些模糊不清的理由早起，或是读到一些“成功人士”和CEO这样做，这些理由都不能帮助你养成早起的习惯。

一旦你意识到早起是为了某一明确目标，你就会把早起视为达成目的的手段，而不是为了早起而早起。

在工作日，我5点钟起床。说实话，我不喜欢这样做。在天黑的时候醒来有些糟糕。但我也不总是讨厌这样做。
[/hint]

And it’s become extremely useful as many can attest to:

Here are some solid benefits of waking up early that have nothing to do with being a CEO or famous celebrity.

[hint]
早起对我来说很有用，很多人都可以证明：

以下是一些早起实实在在的好处，当然这些好处和成为名人或CEO无关。
[/hint]

## You’ll Feel Like You’re Better Than Other People

Woah.

This wasn’t supposed to be one of those self-help articles that speak from a pedestal, so why is this my first point.

[hint]
你会觉得自己比别人优秀
哇。这篇文章不是那种站在高处进行的励志演讲所使用的文章。所以我为什么把它当作第一条？
[/hint]

Confidence matters. Building skills and habits that make you feel better about yourself makes your life better in general. On top of that, human beings are wired to compare ourselves to others. You do it and I do it constantly. So, instead of pretending like we don’t and stay stuck in negative cycles of comparison, why not find ways to feel like you’re better — not intrinsically, but behaviorally — than other people.

When you’re up at the ass crack of dawn working on your side business, exercising, or planning your day, you feel like you have a head start on the rest of the world.

Once the normal time people wake up rolls around, you feel like you’re on pace to get much more done than the average person. And it feels good as hell.

[hint]
信心很重要。培养让你自我感觉更好的技能和习惯，这通常会让你的生活感觉更好。更重要的是，人们天生喜欢与别人比较。你这样做，我也经常这样做。因此，与其假装我们不这样做，并停留在消极的循环中。为什么不找到方法，让自己感觉比别人更好——不是内在，而是行为上的。
[/hint]

## You’ll Stop Doing This So Much

Do you ever find yourself up late at night?

Are you not getting enough sleep?

One of the biggest benefits of waking up early is the ability to go to sleep early.

[hint]
你不会再这么做

你是否发现自己曾在深夜醒来？

你是否没有充足的睡眠？

早起最大的好处之一就是能够早睡早起。
[/hint]

If you wake up at 5 a.m. and you’re productive throughout the day, you’ll be more tired by the end of the night, making it easier to sleep. This creates a better sleep cycle. And sleep is important for your health.

Don’t listen to the “hustle porn” gurus who tell you to skip your shut-eye.

Shorter yet healthy and productive time periods are better than long but tired ones.

[hint]
如果你在早晨5点起来，一整天都很有效率，到了晚上你就会感到更加疲惫，于是更容易早睡。这会创造一种良好的睡眠周期。而且睡眠对你的健康很重要。

不要听那些“色情片”大师跟你说不要睡觉。

较短但健康富有效率的时间比较长但疲惫的时间要好。
[/hint]

## You’ll Appreciate This Much More
Do you have kids?

I have one. A 3-year-old. I love her to death, but let’s just say meditating in silence isn’t one of her favorite activities. When she wakes up, all hell breaks loose. My day has officially started and I can look forward to a ton of noise, distraction, and chaos throughout it.

[hint]
你会心怀感恩

你有孩子了吗？

我有一个3岁的孩子。我爱死他了，但我们只能说，在沉默中冥想不是她最爱的运动之一。当她醒来，一切都乱套了。我的一天正式开始了，我可以开始期待大量的噪音、干扰和混乱了。
[/hint]

I do have a morning routine that I practice religiously. Part of it involves 20 minutes of meditation. I’m not going to write a long treatise about the benefits of meditation. But for me, having just 20 minutes per day where I don’t feel like the world is spinning at ten million hours per hour makes a huge impact on my sanity.

If you’re an adult with kids, especially young ones, you live in the eye of a hurricane. Pile your job, errands, and the other minutiae you have to deal with, it’s enough to drive you nuts.

You don’t have to develop a meditation practice, but you can at least get to enjoy a little time with yourself. A little silence. Trust me, you probably need it.

[hint]
我早晨有专注做训练的习惯。训练的一部分包括20分钟冥想。我不打算写一篇关于冥想的长篇大论。但是对我来说，每天仅仅20分钟的冥想，就不再让我觉得世界以每小时1000万小时的速度运转，这对我的心智产生了巨大的影响。

如果你是个有孩子的成年人，尤其是小孩子，你就生活在飓风中心。把你的工作，杂物和其他需要你处理的事情堆起来，这足以让你发疯。

你不需要进行冥想练习，但是你至少可以享受这一小段和自己独处的时光。一小段宁静的时光。相信我，你可能需要它。
[/hint]

## You’ll Have a Better Chance of Accomplishing This

If you’re like 70 percent of Americans, you don’t exactly love your job.

Maybe you want to switch careers. Maybe you want to start a side business or even just a hobby that helps you exercise your creativity.

[hint]
你会有更好的机会完成这件事

如果你和70%的美国人一样，并不热爱自己的工作。

也许你想要换一份工作。也许你想要做一份副业，甚至只是一种帮助你锻炼创造力的爱好。
[/hint]

I don’t know about you, but waking up early to do that kind of work seems easier than trying to do it after work. If you’re a night owl and that routine works, good for you, don’t change.

But if you feel totally wiped out by the time you’re done with your job, getting dinner together, handling the kids, etc, a morning routine might be the only way to escape the rat race.

I tend to look at self-improvement from a pragmatic perspective. I ask myself “Is this useful?” when it comes to building habits or doing tasks to reach my goals.

[hint]
我不知道你是怎么想的，但是早起去做那样的工作似乎比下班后容易很多。如果你是个夜猫子，而且这种习惯对你有好处，那就不要改变。

但是，如果你在完成工作、共进晚餐、照看孩子等事情之后感到筋疲力尽，那么早晨工作可能是你摆脱激烈竞争的唯一方法。

我倾向于从实用主义的骄傲都看待自我成长。当涉及到需要我养成习惯或是完成任务来达到我的目标时，我会问自己，“这有用吗？”
[/hint]

I built my side business to the point that it dwarfed my job income by waking up early and building it before I went to my 9 to 5. And, with my situation at least, I don’t see how I could’ve done it any other way.

If you find yourself tired and completely de-motivated by the time you’re done with your day, you might have to “rise and grind” (just don’t put that phrase on any of your social media accounts, please).

[hint]
我建立了我的副业，早睡早起，在朝九晚五之前完成建设。这让我的工作收入相形见绌。至少在我当前情况下，我不知道自己还能做什么。

如果你发现你自己很累，工作结束之后感觉精疲力竭，你可能不得不“奋发向上”（请不要在任何社交媒体上使用这个短语）
[/hint]

## You’ll Realize This

A funny thing happened to me when I started waking up early on a regular basis. I noticed how much time there is in a single 24 hour period.

It’s easy to let time slip by and, over a lifetime, you can squander the one commodity that means the most to you.

After squeezing out extra time in my day by getting up earlier, I started noticing other little cracks and crevasses to fit productive time into.

[hint]
你会意识到这一点

当我开始有规律得早睡早起，一件有意思的事情在我身上发生了。我注意到了一天24小时内能有多少时间。

在你的一生中，时间很容易溜走，你可能会浪费对你来说最重要的东西。

在早晨挤出一些额外时间后，我开始注意到其他小裂缝和裂痕，以此适应高效的时间。
[/hint]

I can find little chunks of 10, 15, and 30 minutes to get some reading done. 15 minutes before bed is perfect to do some daily stretching and increase my flexibility.

If you can change your concept of time and what can be done in little chunks, you’ll start to get a lot more done.

[hint]
我可以利用10、15或是30分钟的时间来阅读。睡觉前15分钟是做一些伸展运动来增强自己灵活性的理想时间。

如果你能够改变你对时间的概念，将事情分块完成，你就能完成更多的事情。
[/hint]

## You’ll Hardly Ever Feel Like This
I hate when I feel like I’ve wasted a day.

If you’re lacking motivation, you might not be at this point yet, but when you start doing more work toward your dreams, you may develop a tendency to beat yourself up if you feel like you squandered a day.

When I honor my morning routine, I can always tell myself that I spent at least an hour working on my dream. That’s reassuring and motivates me to wake up and do it all over again.

[hint]
你几乎不会有这种感觉

我讨厌自己浪费一整天的时间。

如果你缺乏动力，你可能还没有到这个阶段。但是当你开始更多的为你的梦想做工作，这时浪费了一整天的时间，你可能会有一种打败自己的倾向。
[/hint]

You don’t have to carve out an hour + each day like I do. Your morning routine can be 10 minutes. Even that small amount of time can help you feel better about the way you spend your time.

It’s easy to have an unproductive day turn into an unproductive month to an unproductive year. Then, you blink and have a mid-life crisis because you feel like you’ve wasted a bunch of time.

Carving out bits and pieces of time each day can help you avoid this fate. String along enough days together and you’ll be able to tell yourself that you worked on your goals consistently for days, weeks, months, and even years at a time.

[hint]
你不必像我一样每天抽出一小时以上的时间。你晨练的时间可能是1.分钟。即使是这样一小段时间，也可以让你对自己的时间安排感觉更好。

毫无成效的一天很容易就会变成毫无成效的一个月甚至是毫无成效的一整年。然后，你一眨眼就陷入了中年危机，因为你感觉自己浪费了很多时间。

每天挤出一点时间可以帮助你避免这种命运。把足够多的时间连在一起，你就能告诉自己，你坚持不懈地为自己的目标奋斗了几天、几周、几个月，甚至几年。
[/hint]

## You’ll Start to Feel This Way (And You’ll Never Want to Go Back)

Some people will tell you that starting a successful morning routine will part the heavens.

You’ll feel amazed and on top of the world every single day.

[hint]
你会开始有这种感觉（然后再也不想回去）

一些人会告诉你，开始一段成功的晨练将会让你快乐无比。

你感觉不可思议，每天都在世界之巅。
[/hint]

Nah, probably not.

But you’ll get used to it.

If you can simply get used to waking up early — not even love it — you’ll be well on your way to achieving whatever long-term goal your mornings serve.

You’ll get to reap the benefits of waking up early over and over again and it will become a habit, meaning you won’t have to do it as begrudgingly as you did when you started.

[hint]
不，这时不可能的。

但你会习惯的。

如果你能习惯早起——甚至不喜欢早起——你就能够很好地实现早晨的长期目标。

你会一次又一次地从早起中获益，早起将会成为一种习惯，这意味着你不必像刚开始那样不情愿的早起。
[/hint]

I cursed at myself several times while my alarm clock went off at 5 a.m. this morning. I have a cold. It snowed a ton and I had a driveway to plow. My disposition wasn’t the sunniest.

But I just got up and started getting shit done.

And I feel pretty damn good about what I’ve accomplished now.

[hint]
今天早晨5点闹钟响的时候，我骂了自己好几次。我感冒了。雪下得很大，我有一条车道要犁。我的心情不是很好。

但是我只是站起来，开始做一些该死的事情。

之后我感觉很棒，我对自己现在的成就感感到很满意。
[/hint]

## The Bottom Line

You don’t have to do anything. Sleep in for the rest of your life if you want. I don’t care.

But if you are looking for a habit that can become a game changer for you, waking up early is definitely one of those habits.

You have a short life and time is ticking incessantly.

Might as well get the most out of each and every day, right?

[hint]
底线

你不需要做任何事。如果你愿意，大可在你的余生里多睡一会。我一点儿也不在乎。

但是如果你在寻找一种可以改变游戏规则的习惯，早起绝对就是其中之一。

生命是短暂的，时间在不停地流逝。

最好每天都充分利用，对吧？
