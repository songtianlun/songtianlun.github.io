It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge. … Not yet, anyway … » 听到这里,首相突然间对福吉产生了恻隐之心,这使他自己也大为吃惊。不过,他的同情转瞬即逝,立刻就被一种自我得意的心情所取代。他想到,他虽说不具备从壁炉里显形的本领,但是在他所管辖的政府部门里,还从来没出过命案呢……至少现在还没有…… » “So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government’s fault after all. » “我想,你接着还会告诉我,西部的那场飓风也是他造成的吧?”首相问。他每走一步,心里的怒火就增长一分。他发现了所有那些可怕灾难的原因,却又不能告诉公众,这简直太令人生气了,如果真是政府的过失反倒还好一些。 » “But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?” » “可是,”首相说,他心里渐渐产生了一种恐惧,“你不是告诉过我,它们这种生物是专门吸走人们的希望和快乐的吗?” » “My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile. » 我亲爱的首相啊,发生这么多事情之后,你真的认为我还能当魔法部部长吗?我三天前就下台了!整个巫师界两个星期来一直叫嚷着要我辞职。我在任这么多年,还从没见过他们这么团结一致!”福吉说着勉强地笑了一下。 » Dear Harry, If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays. If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you. Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this Friday, I am, yours most sincerely, Albus Dumbledore » 亲爱的哈利: 如果你方便的话,我将在本星期五夜里十一点到女贞路四号来接你去陋居,他们邀请你在那里度过暑假剩余的日子。 另外,我在去陋居的路上要办一件事,若能得到你的协助我将非常高兴。详情见面时谈。 请将回信托这只猫头鹰捎回。星期五见。 你最忠实的阿不思·邓布利多 » But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore’s letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage. » 可是哈利没有收拾行李。刚在德思礼家住了两个星期就要被解救出去,这件事太美妙了,不像是真的。他怎么也摆脱不了心头的疑虑,总觉得会有什么地方出差错——他给邓布利多的回信送到别处去了,邓布利多被耽搁了、不能来接他了,或者那封信根本不是邓布利多写来的, 而是一个玩笑、恶作剧或陷阱。如果高高兴兴地收拾好行李,到头来大失所望,还要把东西一件件地从箱子里再拿出来,哈利肯定会受不了的。对于可能到来的旅行,他惟一的举动就是把他那只雪白的猫头鹰海德薇牢牢地关在笼子里。 » Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible. » 哈利一步两级地冲下楼梯,在离楼底还有几级时猛地刹住脚步,长期以来的经验告诉他,任何时候都要尽量与姨父保持距离,别让姨父的手臂够着他。 » It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully. » 也许是邓布利多所显露出的惹人注目的巫师气质,也许只是因为就连弗农姨父也能感觉到,他很难在这个男人面前耀武扬威。 » These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say “excellent” was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye. » 这句话似乎唤醒了弗农姨父。显然对他来说,任何一个能够看着哈利说“太好了”的人,他都永远不可能跟那人达成共识。 » “I don’t mean to be rude —” he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable. » “我不是故意失礼——”他说,话里的每一个音节都透着无礼。 » Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place. » 邓布利多经过达力身边时,达力慌忙闪到一边。哈利跳下最后几级楼梯,跟着邓布利多进了客厅,手里仍然抓着望远镜和运动鞋。邓布利多在最靠近壁炉的扶手椅上坐了下来,带着善意的兴趣打量着房间里的一切。他看上去与周围的环境完全不协调。 » He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position. » 他忽地拔出魔杖,快得哈利都没看清。魔杖轻轻一挥,沙发嗖地冲了过去,撞在德思礼家三个人的膝盖上。他们一下子没有站住脚,全都栽倒在沙发上,滚作一团。魔杖又是轻轻一挥,沙发又嗖地回到了原处。 » As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. » 他把魔杖重新放回了口袋,这时哈利看见他的那只手既干枯又焦黑,好像上面的肉都被烧干了。 » “I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,”Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.” » “我本来以为你们会让我喝点儿什么,”邓布利多对弗农姨父说,“现在看来,这种期望是乐观到了可笑的程度。” » He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave. » 他觉得自己一辈子都忘不了小天狼星曾经在那些昏暗发霉的房间里独自徘徊,被囚禁在那个他日夜渴望离开的地方。 » Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard » 没有一个人说话。邓布利多轻声哼着小曲儿,一副自得其乐的样子,但是屋里的空气比冰冻的牛奶蛋糊还要凝重。 » Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together. » 邓布利多停住了,尽管他的声音还是那么轻松、平静,脸上也没有表现出丝毫的怒容,但哈利感觉到他身上散发出一股寒意。他注意到德思礼一家互相挤缩得更紧了。 » “You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.” » “你们没有按我说的去做。你们从来不把哈利当成自己的儿子。他在你们手里,得到的只是忽视和经常性的虐待。不幸中的万幸,他至少逃脱了你们对坐在你们中间的那个倒霉男孩造成的那种可怕伤害。” » None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed. » 德思礼一家谁也没有吭声。达力微微皱着眉头,似乎还在琢磨他到底受到了什么虐待。弗农姨父看上去像是喉咙里卡了什么东西。佩妮姨妈呢,却莫名其妙地涨红了脸。 » “And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.” » “好了,哈利,让我们走进黑夜里,去追逐那个轻浮而诱人的妖妇——冒险吧。” » Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. » 礼貌要求我们向别的巫师提供拒绝我们的机会。 » “No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.” » “是啊,我也认为没用。比如,你并没有问我最喜欢哪一种果酱, 以此来检验我是否确实是邓布利多教授,而不是一个冒牌货。” » He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair. » 看来他的脸皮厚得惊人,要知道他刚刚可是装成了一把扶手椅被人识破的。 » He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation. » 他推开哈利走了过去,并且坚决地把脸转向一边,像在抵御什么诱惑似的。 » Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, “I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands — it’s been very pleasant, I’ll be sorry to leave. It’s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’t spot you bringing in the piano.” » 斯拉格霍恩恶狠狠地瞪了邓布利多片刻,然后低声说道:“我没有给他们机会。一年来,我一直行踪不定。待在一个地方从来不超过一个星期。从一处麻瓜住宅搬到另一处麻瓜住宅——这幢房子的主人正在加那利群岛 度假呢。我在这儿住得很舒服,真舍不得离开。一旦找到窍门就很容易啦,他们不用窥镜,而用那些可笑的防盗警报器,你只要在上面施一个冰冻魔咒,还有,搬钢琴进来时别让邻居们看见就行了。” » “Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” said Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ” » “乌姆里奇教授跟我们的那些马人发生了冲突。”邓布利多说道,“我想,霍拉斯,你肯定不会大摇大摆地走进禁林,管一群愤怒的马人叫‘肮脏的杂种’吧。” » “Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.” » “哼,是啊。当然啦,作为一名教师,是不应该偏爱学生的,但我就是偏爱她。你的母亲,”斯拉格霍恩看到哈利疑问的目光,补充道,“莉莉·伊万丝,是我教过的最聪明的学生之一。活泼可爱。一个迷人的姑娘。我经常对她说,她应该在我的学院才是。我经常得到她很不客气的回答。” » Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket. » 斯拉格霍恩显得很不安。他摆弄着两根胖胖的大拇指,焦虑地看着邓布利多裹紧了旅行斗篷,哈利拉上了他的夹克衫拉链。 » “Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, but yes.” » “是啊,是啊,”斯拉格霍恩不耐烦地说,“我肯定是疯了,但是没错,我愿意。” » Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer. » 哈利脑海里立刻出现了一只胖鼓鼓的大蜘蛛,它这里吐一根丝,那里吐一根丝,在身体周围结了一张网,把美味多汁的大苍蝇引到自己身边来。 » “I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.” » “哈利,希望你能原谅我提起这个话题,但是在部里发生了那些事情之后,你似乎一直对付得不错,对此我很高兴,还有点儿自豪。请允许我说一句,我认为小天狼星也会为你感到自豪的。” » “It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to realize he won’t write to me again.” » “很难相信,”哈利终于低声说道,“他再也不会给我写信了。” » “Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,” said Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, the loss is devastating. …” » “对你来说,小天狼星代表着许多你以前从不知道的东西。”邓布利多温和地说,“失去他肯定令你感到无比痛苦……” » “But while I was at the Dursleys’ …” interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t shut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius wouldn’t have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life’s too short. …Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance. … It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.” » “可是我在德思礼家的时候,”哈利打断了他的话,声音变得有力了,“我知道我不能把自己封闭起来,也不能——不能自暴自弃。小天狼星肯定不愿意这样,是吗?而且生命太短暂了……看看博恩斯夫人, 看看爱米琳·万斯……下一个可能就是我,对吗?如果真的轮到我,”他直视着邓布利多那双在魔杖的亮光下闪烁的蓝眼睛,激动地说道,“我一定要尽量多消灭几个食死徒,如果可能的话,就跟伏地魔同归于尽。” » “Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry’s back. “I take my hat off to you — or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders. » “说得好,不愧是你父母的儿子、小天狼星的教子!”邓布利多说着赞许地拍了拍哈利的后背,“我要脱帽向你表示敬意——我很想这么做,但我担心会弄得你满身都是蜘蛛。 » “A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. “Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,” he continued, when Harry looked startled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them.” » “总的来说,这么做是明智的,”邓布利多说,“不过我认为你不妨在你的朋友罗恩·韦斯莱先生和赫敏·格兰杰小姐面前松松口。是啊,”看到哈利惊愕的神色,他又说道,“我认为可以让他们知道。你把这么重要的事情瞒着他们,会伤害他们的感情的。” » “— to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.” » “——让他们担惊受怕?”邓布利多从他的半月形眼镜片上方打量着哈利,说道,“或者,不想坦白你自己的担心和恐惧?哈利,你需要朋友。你刚才说得对,小天狼星肯定不愿意你把自己封闭起来。” » “I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” said Dumbledore, nodding. Harry laughed. » “我认为‘彻底失败’这个词用在这里很合适。”邓布利多点点头说。 哈利笑了起来。 » “And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.” » “最后,你住在这里时,陋居得到了魔法部所能提供的最严密的安全保护。这些措施给亚瑟和莫丽带来了一定程度的不便——比如,他们所有的邮件都要经部里审查后才能送达。但他们丝毫不介意,一心只牵挂着你的安全。可是,如果你跟他们住在一起时冒险胡来,可就太对不起他们了。” » Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are. » 我们就让莫丽赶紧有机会哀叹你有多么瘦吧。 » Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. » 海德薇在一个大衣柜顶上朝哈利高兴地叫了几声,然后便振翅飞出了窗外,哈利知道它一直在等着见他一面之后才去觅食。 » It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center —”“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly. » 上次神秘人得势的时候就是这样,到处都有人私奔——”“包括你和爸爸。”金妮调皮地说。 » “Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,” said Hermione. » “邓布利多说,人们容易原谅别人的错误,却很难原谅别人的正确。”赫敏说 » Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them. » 哈利并没有认真地听。他感到全身暖融融的,而且这暖意跟阳光毫无关系,堵在他胸口的那块东西似乎正在渐渐融化。他知道罗恩和赫敏并没有把内心的恐惧都显露出来,但看到他们仍然和他站在一起,说着安慰和鼓励的话,而没有把他当成异类或危险分子,远远地躲开,他觉得这价值是他无法用语言向他们表达的。 » Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs. » 韦斯莱夫人挤过他们身边,打开了厨房的窗户。一只、两只、三只猫头鹰从窗口飞了进来,落在桌子上,整整齐齐地站成一排,步调一致地抬起了右腿。 » ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTS Pass Grades Fail Grades Outstanding (O) Poor (P) Exceeds Expectations (E) Dreadful (D) Acceptable (A) Troll (T) » “Well, we’re N.E.W.T. students now!” grinned Ron. “Mum, are there any more sausages?” » “太好了,我们现在是N.E.W.Ts的学生了!”罗恩笑着说,“妈妈,还有香肠吗?” » It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago. … Neither can live while the other survives. … Wouldn’t he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort? » 说来也奇怪,最初告诉哈利他会成为一名出色的傲罗的,是一个伪装的食死徒,但不知怎的,这个想法在哈利心里生了根,他想象不出除此之外他还愿意做什么。而且,自从一个月前听了那个预言之后,这似乎已是他注定的命运……两个人不能都活着……如果他加入那支足智多谋、以追捕和消灭伏地魔为己任的巫师队伍,他岂不是就能实施那个预言,给自己一个最大的生存机会吗? » “That’s right. … Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we’re still getting massive orders!” » “没错……嘿,我们本来以为防咒帽只是一种搞笑的玩意儿。你知道的,就是你戴着这种帽子叫你的同伴给你施恶咒,然后你盯着他的脸,恶咒就会反弹出去。没想到魔法部给他们所有的工作人员买了五百顶!现在我们还不断接到大额订单呢!” » “Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays. » “我们的脚会被人看见的!”赫敏担心地说,因为隐形衣的下摆在他们脚脖子周围掀动着。如今,他们三个人藏在它下面比以前困难多了。 » “People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty. » “人们认为你应该有比我们更带劲的朋友。”卢娜说,又一次显示了她哪壶不开提哪壶的本领。 » You should hear my gran talk about you. ‘That Harry Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!’ » 你真该听听我奶奶是怎么说你的。‘那个哈利·波特比整个魔法部的人加在一起还有骨气!’ » “A Wrackspurt … They’re invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she said. “I thought I felt one zooming around in here.” » “骚扰虻……它们是隐形的,会飘到你耳朵里,把你的脑子搞乱。”她说,“我刚才好像觉得有一只在这里嗡嗡地飞。” » He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant » 他沉思地端详着哈利,似乎哈利是一只肥墩墩的、美味多汁的鹌鹑 » The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late. » 哈利内心的愤怒和仇恨简直白热化了,他宁愿全身僵硬地返回伦敦,也不愿告诉斯内普他迟到的原因。 » Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening. » 哈利仍然保持着沉默,尽管他觉得肺都要气炸了。他知道斯内普来接他就是为了这个,他可以有几分钟时间激怒和折磨哈利,而不会被任何人听见。 » “It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. “But there are some injuries you can’t cure … old curses … and there are poisons without antidotes. …” » “那只手看上去像是死了。”赫敏脸上带着难受的表情说,“有些伤永远治不好……古老的咒语……还有一些魔药是没有解药的……” » Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh. » 哈利把事情告诉了他。罗恩没有笑,这显示了他们的友谊是多么牢固。 » In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination. » 事实上,他与蛇对话的能力并没有使我感到很不安,令我担心的是他明显表现出来的那种残酷、诡秘和霸道的天性。 » I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self- sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? » 我相信你同样也注意到了,汤姆·里德尔当时已经极为自信,讳莫如深,而且显然没有一个朋友。 » “Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.” » “眼光很敏锐,哈利,但口琴只是一把口琴而已。” » It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great distance away. » 似乎有个全身长鳞的大家伙在哈利心头突然活了起来,并用爪子抓挠着他的五脏六腑,热血一下子冲上了他的脑袋,所有的理性都被压制住了,取而代之的是一股强烈的冲动,只想用恶咒把迪安变成一堆果子冻。他与这种突如其来的疯狂念头搏斗着,听见罗恩的声音像是从很远的地方传来。 » Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system. » 赫敏从讲台上滑了下来。那群金黄色的小鸟继续围着她的脑袋叽叽喳喳地飞着,这使她看上去像一个奇怪的、长着羽毛的太阳系模型。 » “I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work —” » “我不是说你那个愚蠢的所谓王子,”赫敏凶巴巴地瞪了他的书一眼,好像它招惹了她似的,“我是说刚才,到这儿来之前,我去盥洗室,那儿有一打女孩子,包括罗米达·万尼,都在讨论着怎么能让你喝下迷情剂。她们都希望能被你带去参加斯拉格霍恩的晚会,而且好像都买了弗雷德和乔治的迷情剂——” » Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. » 帕瓦蒂满脸带笑,哈利看得出她在为变形课上笑了赫敏感到内疚。 他扭头一看,见赫敏也是一副笑容,如果可能的话,甚至可以说是灿烂的笑容。女孩子有时真是很奇怪。 » She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. » 她走了。拉文德和帕瓦蒂马上把脑袋凑在一起议论着这个新情况, 包括她们对麦克拉根的一切耳闻,以及她们对赫敏的一切猜测。罗恩表情异常麻木,一言不发。哈利留在那儿,思考着女孩子为了报复可以陷得有多深。 » Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. » 只有弗雷德、乔治、哈利和罗恩知道圣诞树顶上的小天使其实是一个花园小地精。弗雷德在拔圣诞晚餐用的胡萝卜时被这个小地精咬了脚踝,于是它被施了昏迷咒,涂成金色,塞进了一件小芭蕾舞裙,背上粘了对小翅膀,在树顶上对他们怒目而视。这是哈利见过的最丑的天使,长着土豆似的大秃脑袋,脚上还有毛。 » And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now. » 晚上剩下的时间是在友好的气氛中度过的,两人共同批判了魔法部长。赫敏跟罗恩一样认为,魔法部去年让哈利吃了那么多苦头,现在又来找他帮忙,脸皮真够厚的。 » Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face. » 他沉浸在憧憬中,魔杖挥得劲太足了点儿,把那天魔咒课作业要变的一股清泉变成了一道水龙,射到天花板上反弹下来,正打在弗立维教授的脸上。 » “Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!” » “啊,哈利,这是多么常见的事情,即使在最好的朋友之间!我们都相信自己要说的比对方的重要得多!” » I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death. » 我相信就是在那时他抛弃了这个名字,改称伏地魔的,并开始调查以前被他轻视的他母亲的家史——你应该记得,他认为那个女人既然屈从于死亡这一人类的可耻弱点,就不可能是巫师。 » Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of fear. » 哈利不禁对伏地魔的毫无畏惧感到一种恼火的钦佩。 » “You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by —” » “你说得很对——他们能测出魔法,但测不出施魔法者:你还记得魔法部指控你施了悬停魔咒,而实际上是——” » “The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D’s!”said Twycross. “Destination, Determination, Deliberation! » “幻影显形时最重要的是要记住三个D!”泰克罗斯说,“即目标,决心,从容 !” » “Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.” » “还真是,现在想起来,我们家好像有一半人的命都是你救的。”韦斯莱先生说,他的嗓子眼有些发紧,“我只能说,罗恩在霍格沃茨特快列车上决定坐在你的车厢里,那真是幸运的一天,哈利。” » “Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a long pause, and Harry’s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing. … » “你昏迷的时候金妮来过。”停了好长时间,他说。哈利的想象立刻超速运转起来,飞快构思出一幕画面——金妮对着他没有知觉的身体抽泣,表白着她对他深深的爱恋,罗恩为他们俩祝福…… » “I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?” » “噢,”邓布利多从半月形的眼镜片上方盯着哈利,哈利又有一种被X光照射的感觉,“你觉得已经尽了最大努力,是吗?已经充分发挥了你的聪明才智?想尽了一切点子?” » A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything. » 一阵火辣辣的、针扎一般的羞耻感从哈利的头顶传遍全身。邓布利多没有提高嗓门,甚至话语中也没带怒气,但哈利宁愿他大吼大叫,这种冰冷的失望比什么都令人难受。 » Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore’s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. » 两人又沉默了,这是哈利在邓布利多身边经历过的最难堪的沉默, 它似乎无休无止,只是时而被邓布利多头顶上阿芒多·迪佩特哼哼哧哧的鼾声打断。哈利有一种奇怪的渺小感,好像自己进屋后缩小了。 » “I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. “Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.” » “我相信他有好几条理由,尽管他一条也没有告诉迪佩特教授。”邓布利多说,“首先,很重要的一条是,伏地魔对这所学校比他对任何个人更有感情。霍格沃茨是他最开心的地方,是他感到像家的第一个也是惟一的地方。” » “So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.” » “伏地魔去了博金-博克,所有欣赏他的教员都说可惜,那样一个才华出众的年轻巫师去当了店员。但伏地魔不只是店员。他因为彬彬有礼,英俊聪明,很快就得到了只有博金-博克这种地方才有的特殊工作。你知道,哈利,这家店专销有特异性能的物品。伏地魔被派去说服别人将宝物交给店里出售,据说,他对此事特别擅长。” » “So, Tom … to what do I owe the pleasure?” » “那么,汤姆……是什么风把你吹来的?” » He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such. » 他举起杯子,像要跟伏地魔干杯。伏地魔还是面无表情。但哈利感到屋里的气氛发生了微妙的变化:邓布利多拒绝用伏地魔选定的称呼, 是拒绝让伏地魔支配谈话。哈利看得出伏地魔也感觉到了。 » Voldemort’s expression remained impassive as he said, “Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.”“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?” asked Dumbledore delicately. » 伏地魔依然面无表情,说道:“伟大引起嫉妒,嫉妒导致怨毒,怨毒滋生谎言。这你一定了解,邓布利多。”“你把你的所作所为称为‘伟大’,是吗?”邓布利多优雅地问。 » For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage. » 伏地魔第一次笑了,那是一种睥睨的讥笑,邪恶的表情,比暴怒更加可怕。 » “The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.” » “老论调,”他轻声说,“可是,邓布利多,我在世上所见没有一样能证明你那著名的观点:爱比我那种魔法更加强大。” » Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture. » 邓布利多放下空杯子,坐直身子,双手指尖碰在一起,这是他惯有的姿势。 » “No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. “The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. … I wish I could. …” » “没有了。”邓布利多说,脸上露出深深的悲哀,“我能用燃烧的衣柜吓住你,迫使你赎罪的时间早已过去。可我希望能,汤姆……我希望能……” » Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all … and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. … » 哈利一时没有回答,接着,慢慢地但是确确实实地,一种无比振奋的感觉流向全身,仿佛有无限的机会。他感到自己能做任何事,一切事……从斯拉格霍恩那里搞到记忆突然好像不仅可能,而且简直是轻而易举…… » Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby. » 斯拉格霍恩举起胖手,把颤抖的手指按到嘴上,他一时看上去像个庞大的婴儿。 » It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. » 恰到好处,哈利想,那种犹豫、不经意的语气,巧妙的恭维,一点儿都没有过火。哈利自己有过太多从不情愿的人嘴里套取信息的经历, 不会认不出一个行家。他看得出里德尔非常非常想要这个信息,也许为这一刻已经筹划了好几个星期。 » “Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form …” » “就是说,你把你的灵魂分裂开,”斯拉格霍恩说,“将一部分藏在身体外的某个物体中。这样,即使你的身体遭到袭击或摧毁,你也死不了,因为还有一部分灵魂留在世间,未受损害。但是,当然,以这种形式存在……” » “By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —” » “通过邪恶的行为——最邪恶的行为,通过谋杀。杀人会使灵魂分裂,想要制造魂器的巫师则利用这种破坏,把分裂出的灵魂碎片封存——” » Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ » 种种迹象都很吻合——这些年来伏地魔似乎变得越来越不像人,我想那种变形只能解释为,他的灵魂受到的破坏超出了我们所说的一般邪恶的范围…… » “So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?” » “那,日记毁了,戒指毁了,杯子、挂坠盒和蛇还在,你认为还有一个魂器可能是拉文克劳或格兰芬多的遗物?” » “I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, “Big deal!”“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. “Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.” » “我知道!”哈利不耐烦地说,“我有爱!”他好容易才没有加上:“有什么了不起!”“是的,哈利,你有爱,”邓布利多好像十分了解哈利舌头底下压着的话,“想想你经历的一切,这是非常了不起的。你还太年轻,不知道你是多么特殊,哈利。” » “Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!” » “对——就是爱。”邓布利多说,“但是哈利,永远不要忘记,预言的意义只是伏地魔造成的。我去年年底跟你讲过这一点。伏地魔把你当成对他最危险的人——而这样一来,他就使你变成了对他最危险的人!” » “Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!” » “哈利呀,哈利,那只是因为伏地魔犯了个大错误,他按特里劳妮教授的预言采取了行动!如果伏地魔没有杀死你父亲,会让你产生强烈的复仇欲望吗?当然不会!如果他没有逼你母亲为你而死,会让你得到他无法穿透的魔法保护吗?当然不会!哈利。你看不到吗?伏地魔自己制造了他最可怕的敌人,就像普天下的暴君一样!你知道暴君多么害怕被压迫的人民吗?他们都知道总有一天,在众多受害者中会有一个起来奋起反击!伏地魔也一样。他总是在寻找那个会向他挑战的人,听到预言后就马上行动,结果他不仅亲手选出了那个最有可能除掉他的人,而且给了他一件特别致命的武器!” » “It is essential that you understand this!” said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. “By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort’s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort’s followers!” » “你必须明白这一点!”邓布利多站了起来,在屋子里大步地走来走去,闪亮的袍子在身后呼呼飘动。哈利还从没见他这么激动过,“在企图杀你的时候,伏地魔就亲自选出了坐在我面前的这个卓越的人,并为他提供了工具!你能看到伏地魔的思想、野心,甚至能听懂他发令时那蛇说话般的语言,这都只能怪他自己。可是,哈利,尽管你能洞察伏地魔的世界——要知道,这是任何食死徒不惜用杀人来换取的能力,但你却从未接受黑魔法的诱惑,从未显露过丝毫想要追随伏地魔的欲望,一秒钟都没有!” » “You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said Dumbledore loudly. “The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort’s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! “But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort’s mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.” » “简而言之,是你的爱保护了你!”邓布利多大声说,“惟有这种保护,才有可能抵御伏地魔那样的权力的诱惑!虽然经历了那么多诱惑, 那么多痛苦,你依然心地纯洁,还像你十一岁时那样。当时你向那面能照出你内心愿望的镜子中望去,看到的只有怎样挫败伏地魔,而没有永生和财富。哈利,你知不知道,世上没有几个巫师能看到你在镜中看到的东西?伏地魔那时就该知道他要对付的是什么,可惜他没有! “但他现在知道了。你侵入了伏地魔的思想而不受损害,他想附在你身上时却不能不忍受剧烈的痛苦,他在部里已经发现了这一点。但我想他不了解这是为什么,哈利。他那样忙于破坏自己的灵魂,从来无暇去了解一个纯洁健全的灵魂拥有何等无与伦比的力量。” » Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. » 看着面前踱来踱去的邓布利多,哈利沉思起来。他想到了他的母亲、他的父亲和小天狼星,想到了塞德里克,想到了伏地魔的种种罪行。他的胸中腾起一股烈焰,直烧到喉咙口。 » “Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. … In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you … which makes it certain, really, that —” » “你当然会!”邓布利多叫道,“你看,预言并没表示你必须做什么!但预言使伏地魔认定你是他的对手……换句话说,你有权选择自己的道路,有权不理睬那个预言!但伏地魔还是会对它念念不忘,他会继续追杀你……所以确实是必然——” » But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world. » 他终于明白了邓布利多要告诉他的意思,那就是:被拽进角斗场去面对一场殊死搏斗和自己昂首走进去是不同的。也许有人会说这二者之间并无多少不同,但邓布利多知道——我也知道,哈利带着一阵强烈的自豪感想道,我父母也知道——这是世界上全部的不同。 » “Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. “Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.” » “懦夫,”赫敏说道,不过看上去挺愉快的,“哎,昨晚好像罗曼司普遍不利,金妮和迪安也分手了,哈利。” » . And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. » 更麻烦的是,他焦虑地想到如果自己不采取行动,肯定很快就会有别人约会金妮了。他和罗恩至少在这一点上看法是一致的:金妮太招人喜欢了,这对她本人没好处。 » Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening. » 哈利和罗恩目瞪口呆——向来关系很好的赫敏和金妮现在都抱着胳膊坐在那里,眼睛瞪着相反的方向。罗恩不安地看看哈利,然后随手抓起一本书,躲到书后面去了。哈利虽然知道自己不配,却还是突然感到难以置信的快乐,尽管他们一晚上都没有再说话。 » Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. » 哈利看看周围,金妮向他奔来,她张开双臂抱住了他,脸上是一种炽烈的表情。于是,没有想,没有准备,没有担心有五十个人在看着, 哈利吻了她。 » After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you must. » 过了长长的几分钟——也可能有半个小时——或阳光灿烂的几天——他们才分开了。屋里变得非常安静。然后有几个人吹起了口哨,有人不自然地吃吃笑了起来。哈利越过金妮的头顶,看到迪安手里举着一个破杯子,罗米达·万尼好像要摔东西,赫敏在笑,但哈利的眼睛在寻找罗恩,终于找到了,他还攥着奖杯,看上去像当头挨了一棍似的。两人对视了片刻,罗恩的脑袋微微动了一下,哈利知道那意思是:“好吧——如果你一定要。” » “Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. “Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.” » “够了。”邓布利多说。虽然他说得极其平静,但是哈利马上沉默下来,因为他知道自己最终越过了一道看不见的底线,“你以为今年我有哪次是毫无保护措施就离开学校的吗?我还没有过。今晚,当我离开时,各处将会有额外的防御措施。请不要认为我没有认真对待我的学生们的安全,哈利。” » Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. » 哈利可以闻到大海的气味,听见波涛汹涌的声音。他望着远处月光下的大海和繁星点点的夜空,一阵寒冷的微风吹拂着他的头发。他站在一块露出海面的高高的黑色岩石上,海浪在他脚下翻滚,泛起泡沫。他扭头朝后望去。身后耸立着一座悬崖,陡峭的岩壁直落而下,黑糊糊的看不清面目。几块很大的岩石,如哈利和邓布利多站着的这块,似乎是过去某个时候从悬崖的正面脱落下来的。四下里光秃秃的,满目荒凉, 除了苍茫的大海和岩石,看不见一棵树,也没有草地和沙滩。 » “Lumos,” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. » “荧光闪烁!”邓布利多下到最靠近悬崖正面的那块巨型卵石上,蹲下身念了句咒语。星星点点的金光在他身下几英尺处的黝黑海面上闪烁着。他身边那道漆黑的岩壁也被照亮了。 » Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. » 哈利没有问邓布利多是怎么知道的。他从没见过哪个巫师这样解决难题:只用眼睛看,用手摸。不过哈利早就知道,弄得乒乒乓乓、烟雾大作的,通常是水平较低的人的特点,而不是高手的做派。 » Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury. » 伏地魔又一次没能理解,有许多东西比肉体的伤害更可怕得多。 » “I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. “I am with you.” » “我不担心,哈利,”邓布利多说,尽管海水寒冷刺骨,他的声音却多了一点儿气力,“我和你在一起呢。” » “Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. “But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now, we are quite alone, I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted. …” » “是的,我很在意。”邓布利多说,这时哈利看见他双脚在地面上打了一个滑,使劲撑着不让自己瘫倒,“至于你要取我性命的事,德拉科,已经过去好几分钟了。周围没有别人,我现在手无寸铁,你做梦也不会想到有这样的好机会,可你还是没有动手……” » The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. » 这声音比哈利整晚经历的任何事情都叫他害怕。邓布利多在哀求, 这可是破天荒的第一次。 » A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry’s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backward, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight. » 斯内普的魔杖尖上射出一道绿光,不偏不倚地击中了邓布利多的胸膛。哈利惊恐的尖叫声被憋在了喉咙里,他发不出声音,也动弹不得, 只能眼睁睁地望着邓布利多被击到空中。邓布利多似乎在那闪亮的骷髅下停留了一秒钟,然后像一个破烂的大玩偶似的,慢慢地仰面倒下去, 从围墙的垛口上栽下去不见了。 » And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech — » 斯内普猛烈地抽打着空气。哈利感到有种白热的、像鞭子一样的东西打在脸上。他被重重地抽倒在地上,满眼冒着金星,有一阵子好像停止了呼吸。就在这时,他听见一阵翅膀的扑棱声,巨大的影子遮住了天空中的星星。巴克比克已经飞到了斯内普的头上,刀一样锋利的爪子抓得斯内普连连后退。哈利坐了起来,刚才撞到地上的脑袋还眩晕着,只见斯内普拼命奔跑着,巨大的巴克比克拍着翅膀在后面紧追不放,发出一种哈利从未听过的尖厉吼叫—— » Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him. » 一听到邓布利多的名字,哈利的胃里一阵剧烈的灼痛。沉默和寂静中,恐惧感在体内增长。 » Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. … As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. … » 哈利也不再试图争辩或解释了。他仍然不由自主地瑟瑟发抖。海格很快就会知道的……当他们朝城堡走去时,哈利见到许多窗子里的灯都亮了。他可以清楚地想象里面的情景,大家奔走相告,描述食死徒刚刚进来的情景,黑魔标记闪耀在霍格沃茨魔法学校的上空,一定有人被杀了…… » Harry heard Hagrid’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet. » 哈利听见了海格痛苦和震惊的呻吟声,但他没有停住脚步,继续慢慢地向前移动,直到他走到邓布利多躺着的地方,蹲在他的身旁。 当邓布利多施在他身上的全身束缚咒解开后,哈利就知道没有希望了,如果施魔咒的人不死,魔咒是不会自然解开的。但是哈利仍没有心理准备见到眼前这一幕:他今生今世遇到的、也许以后再也遇不到的最好的巫师,四肢摊开,手脚折断,横躺在眼前。 » Dumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half- moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help. … » 邓布利多双眼紧闭,从他四肢摊开的角度看起来像是在熟睡。哈利伸手扶正那鹰钩鼻上的半月形眼镜,用自己的袖子擦了一下他嘴角的血痕,然后低头凝视着那张充满智慧的苍老的脸庞,努力地去面对这个难以接受的事实:邓布利多再也不会对他说什么了,再也不可能帮他什么了…… » A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry’s vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase. » 一只小了许多的、更加温暖的手握住了哈利的手,把他向上拉着。 哈利糊里糊涂地顺势站了起来,直到他茫然地穿过人群,从空气中飘来了一丝花香,这才意识到是金妮一直在拉着他往城堡里走。听不清楚的话语从四面传来,抽泣、叫喊和哀号划破了夜空,但哈利和金妮继续向前,走上台阶,进入门厅。一张张面孔在哈利视线边缘晃动,人们盯着他,窃窃私语,惊愕迷茫。他们向大理石楼梯走去,格兰芬多的红宝石散落在地上,闪耀着血滴一样的红光。 » Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows. » 庞弗雷夫人用手捂住嘴,咽着泪水,眼睛睁得大大的。在外面黑暗中的某个地方,凤凰正在用哈利从未听过的方式唱着令人动容的凄婉挽歌。像以前听凤凰的歌声一样,哈利感觉到这首挽歌的曲子是在他的脑海里,而不是在现实中,仿佛是他自己的悲伤化作了挽歌,在校园里和城堡的窗户间回荡。 » “You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?”said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. “What do I care how he looks? I am good- looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her. » “你认为我会不想和他结婚?或者你希望我不想和他结婚?”芙蓉说,鼻翼翕动,“我只是在乎他的长相吗?我认为我一个人的美貌对我们俩来说已经足够了!所有这些伤疤说明我的丈夫是勇敢的!我来!”她气势汹汹地加了一句,一边推开韦斯莱太太,从她手中抢过药膏。 » And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks. » 突然,哈利还没有反应过来是怎么回事——两个女人抱头痛哭。哈利被彻底搞糊涂了,转过身去,怀疑这个世界是不是疯了。罗恩看起来和哈利一样惊讶。金妮和赫敏也在交换着惊讶的眼神。 » “Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,” said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in. » “如果这个世界拥有更多的爱,邓布利多会比任何人都更高兴。”麦格教授简短地说,这时门又开了,海格走了进来。 » And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world … had left Harry. » 他知道——虽然搞不清为什么会知道——凤凰已经走了,永远地离开了霍格沃茨,像邓布利多一样永远地离开了学校,离开了这个世界……离开了哈利。 » An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs; shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air. » 一半椅子上已经坐了人,这些人各式各样,鱼龙混杂:有衣衫褴褛的,也有整洁体面的;有老年人,也有年轻人。大多数人哈利都不认识,但有一些他是知道的,其中包括凤凰社的成员:金斯莱·沙克尔, 疯眼汉穆迪,唐克斯——她的头发又奇迹般地变成了耀眼的粉红色,莱姆斯·卢平——唐克斯跟他手拉着手,韦斯莱夫妇,还有芙蓉搀扶着比尔,后面跟着穿黑色火龙皮夹克衫的弗雷德和乔治。此外还有马克西姆夫人——她一个人就占了两把半椅子,破釜酒吧的老板汤姆,哈利的哑炮邻居阿拉贝拉·费格,古怪姐妹演唱组里那位毛发粗重的低音提琴手,骑士公共汽车驾驶员厄恩·普兰,对角巷长袍专卖店的摩金夫人, 还有几个人哈利只是看着面熟,如猪头酒吧的那个服务员,霍格沃茨特快列车上推小车的女巫。城堡里的幽灵也来了,在阳光下几乎看不见他们,只有走动时才能辨认出来,在明亮的空气中闪烁着虚幻的光芒。 » She met Harry’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died. » 但金妮已经不哭了,她迎着哈利的目光,神情刚毅而热烈,就像哈利缺席的那天球队赢得魁地奇杯后她拥抱哈利的时候那样。在那一刻,哈利知道他们彼此心心相印,知道当他把他要做的事情告诉她时,她不会说“你要小心”或“你别去做”, 而是会欣然接受他的决定,因为她从心底里知道他就是那样一个人。于是,他咬咬牙,说出了自从邓布利多死后他就知道非说不可的话。 » Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful. » 哈利不胜惊讶地望着他。世界上仍然存在婚礼这样平凡的事情,真是令人不可思议,同时也令人感到美妙无比。 » His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione. » 他的手不由自主地握紧了那个假魂器,尽管种种的一切,尽管等待他的是一条漆黑而曲折的道路,尽管他知道最后——不管是一个月、一年、或是十年之后——他肯定要跟伏地魔面对面地较量,可是想到他仍然可以和罗恩、赫敏一起享受最后一个黄金般的平静日子,他就感到心情无比的愉快。 »  ","wordCount":"19989","inLanguage":"zh","datePublished":"2019-11-03T16:53:00Z","dateModified":"2019-11-03T16:53:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Tianlun Song"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://www.frytea.com/posts/essay/174/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Frytea","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://www.frytea.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body class=list id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://www.frytea.com/ accesskey=h title="🏡 Frytea (Alt + H)">🏡 Frytea</a>

It was, however, eclipsed almost immediately by a glow of smugness at the thought that, deficient though he himself might be in the area of materializing out of fireplaces, there had never been a murder in any of the government departments under his charge. … Not yet, anyway … &#187;</li><li>听到这里,首相突然间对福吉产生了恻隐之心,这使他自己也大为吃惊。不过,他的同情转瞬即逝,立刻就被一种自我得意的心情所取代。他想到,他虽说不具备从壁炉里显形的本领,但是在他所管辖的政府部门里,还从来没出过命案呢……至少现在还没有…… &#187;</li><li>“So I suppose you’re going to tell me he caused the hurricane in the West Country too?” said the Prime Minister, his temper rising with every pace he took. It was infuriating to discover the reason for all these terrible disasters and not to be able to tell the public, almost worse than it being the government’s fault after all. &#187;</li><li>“我想,你接着还会告诉我,西部的那场飓风也是他造成的吧?”首相问。他每走一步,心里的怒火就增长一分。他发现了所有那些可怕灾难的原因,却又不能告诉公众,这简直太令人生气了,如果真是政府的过失反倒还好一些。 &#187;</li><li>“But,” said the Prime Minister, with a sense of dawning horror, “didn’t you tell me they’re the creatures that drain hope and happiness out of people?” &#187;</li><li>“可是,”首相说,他心里渐渐产生了一种恐惧,“你不是告诉过我,它们这种生物是专门吸走人们的希望和快乐的吗?” &#187;</li><li>“My dear Prime Minister, you can’t honestly think I’m still Minister of Magic after all this? I was sacked three days ago! The whole Wizarding community has been screaming for my resignation for a fortnight. I’ve never known them so united in my whole term of office!” said Fudge, with a brave attempt at a smile. &#187;</li><li>我亲爱的首相啊,发生这么多事情之后,你真的认为我还能当魔法部部长吗?我三天前就下台了!整个巫师界两个星期来一直叫嚷着要我辞职。我在任这么多年,还从没见过他们这么团结一致!”福吉说着勉强地笑了一下。 &#187;</li><li>Dear Harry, If it is convenient to you, I shall call at number four, Privet Drive this coming Friday at eleven p.m. to escort you to the Burrow, where you have been invited to spend the remainder of your school holidays. If you are agreeable, I should also be glad of your assistance in a matter to which I hope to attend on the way to the Burrow. I shall explain this more fully when I see you. Kindly send your answer by return of this owl. Hoping to see you this Friday, I am, yours most sincerely, Albus Dumbledore &#187;</li><li>亲爱的哈利: 如果你方便的话,我将在本星期五夜里十一点到女贞路四号来接你去陋居,他们邀请你在那里度过暑假剩余的日子。 另外,我在去陋居的路上要办一件事,若能得到你的协助我将非常高兴。详情见面时谈。 请将回信托这只猫头鹰捎回。星期五见。 你最忠实的阿不思·邓布利多 &#187;</li><li>But Harry had not packed. It just seemed too good to be true that he was going to be rescued from the Dursleys after a mere fortnight of their company. He could not shrug off the feeling that something was going to go wrong — his reply to Dumbledore’s letter might have gone astray; Dumbledore could be prevented from collecting him; the letter might turn out not to be from Dumbledore at all, but a trick or joke or trap. Harry had not been able to face packing and then being let down and having to unpack again. The only gesture he had made to the possibility of a journey was to shut his snowy owl, Hedwig, safely in her cage. &#187;</li><li>可是哈利没有收拾行李。刚在德思礼家住了两个星期就要被解救出去,这件事太美妙了,不像是真的。他怎么也摆脱不了心头的疑虑,总觉得会有什么地方出差错——他给邓布利多的回信送到别处去了,邓布利多被耽搁了、不能来接他了,或者那封信根本不是邓布利多写来的, 而是一个玩笑、恶作剧或陷阱。如果高高兴兴地收拾好行李,到头来大失所望,还要把东西一件件地从箱子里再拿出来,哈利肯定会受不了的。对于可能到来的旅行,他惟一的举动就是把他那只雪白的猫头鹰海德薇牢牢地关在笼子里。 &#187;</li><li>Harry ran down the stairs two at a time, coming to an abrupt halt several steps from the bottom, as long experience had taught him to remain out of arm’s reach of his uncle whenever possible. &#187;</li><li>哈利一步两级地冲下楼梯,在离楼底还有几级时猛地刹住脚步,长期以来的经验告诉他,任何时候都要尽量与姨父保持距离,别让姨父的手臂够着他。 &#187;</li><li>It might have been the blatant wizardishness of his appearance, but it might, too, have been that even Uncle Vernon could sense that here was a man whom it would be very difficult to bully. &#187;</li><li>也许是邓布利多所显露出的惹人注目的巫师气质,也许只是因为就连弗农姨父也能感觉到,他很难在这个男人面前耀武扬威。 &#187;</li><li>These words seemed to rouse Uncle Vernon. It was clear that as far as he was concerned, any man who could look at Harry and say “excellent” was a man with whom he could never see eye to eye. &#187;</li><li>这句话似乎唤醒了弗农姨父。显然对他来说,任何一个能够看着哈利说“太好了”的人,他都永远不可能跟那人达成共识。 &#187;</li><li>“I don’t mean to be rude —” he began, in a tone that threatened rudeness in every syllable. &#187;</li><li>“我不是故意失礼——”他说,话里的每一个音节都透着无礼。 &#187;</li><li>Dudley scrambled out of the way as Dumbledore passed him. Harry, still clutching the telescope and trainers, jumped the last few stairs and followed Dumbledore, who had settled himself in the armchair nearest the fire and was taking in the surroundings with an expression of benign interest. He looked quite extraordinarily out of place. &#187;</li><li>邓布利多经过达力身边时,达力慌忙闪到一边。哈利跳下最后几级楼梯,跟着邓布利多进了客厅,手里仍然抓着望远镜和运动鞋。邓布利多在最靠近壁炉的扶手椅上坐了下来,带着善意的兴趣打量着房间里的一切。他看上去与周围的环境完全不协调。 &#187;</li><li>He drew his wand so rapidly that Harry barely saw it; with a casual flick, the sofa zoomed forward and knocked the knees out from under all three of the Dursleys so that they collapsed upon it in a heap. Another flick of the wand and the sofa zoomed back to its original position. &#187;</li><li>他忽地拔出魔杖,快得哈利都没看清。魔杖轻轻一挥,沙发嗖地冲了过去,撞在德思礼家三个人的膝盖上。他们一下子没有站住脚,全都栽倒在沙发上,滚作一团。魔杖又是轻轻一挥,沙发又嗖地回到了原处。 &#187;</li><li>As he replaced his wand in his pocket, Harry saw that his hand was blackened and shriveled; it looked as though his flesh had been burned away. &#187;</li><li>他把魔杖重新放回了口袋,这时哈利看见他的那只手既干枯又焦黑,好像上面的肉都被烧干了。 &#187;</li><li>“I would assume that you were going to offer me refreshment,”Dumbledore said to Uncle Vernon, “but the evidence so far suggests that that would be optimistic to the point of foolishness.” &#187;</li><li>“我本来以为你们会让我喝点儿什么,”邓布利多对弗农姨父说,“现在看来,这种期望是乐观到了可笑的程度。” &#187;</li><li>He thought he would be haunted forever by the memory of Sirius prowling its dark musty rooms alone, imprisoned within the place he had wanted so desperately to leave. &#187;</li><li>他觉得自己一辈子都忘不了小天狼星曾经在那些昏暗发霉的房间里独自徘徊,被囚禁在那个他日夜渴望离开的地方。 &#187;</li><li>Nobody was talking. Dumbledore was humming quietly, apparently quite at his ease, but the atmosphere was thicker than cold custard &#187;</li><li>没有一个人说话。邓布利多轻声哼着小曲儿,一副自得其乐的样子,但是屋里的空气比冰冻的牛奶蛋糊还要凝重。 &#187;</li><li>Dumbledore paused, and although his voice remained light and calm, and he gave no obvious sign of anger, Harry felt a kind of chill emanating from him and noticed that the Dursleys drew very slightly closer together. &#187;</li><li>邓布利多停住了,尽管他的声音还是那么轻松、平静,脸上也没有表现出丝毫的怒容,但哈利感觉到他身上散发出一股寒意。他注意到德思礼一家互相挤缩得更紧了。 &#187;</li><li>“You did not do as I asked. You have never treated Harry as a son. He has known nothing but neglect and often cruelty at your hands. The best that can be said is that he has at least escaped the appalling damage you have inflicted upon the unfortunate boy sitting between you.” &#187;</li><li>“你们没有按我说的去做。你们从来不把哈利当成自己的儿子。他在你们手里,得到的只是忽视和经常性的虐待。不幸中的万幸,他至少逃脱了你们对坐在你们中间的那个倒霉男孩造成的那种可怕伤害。” &#187;</li><li>None of the Dursleys said anything. Dudley was frowning slightly, as though he was still trying to work out when he had ever been mistreated. Uncle Vernon looked as though he had something stuck in his throat; Aunt Petunia, however, was oddly flushed. &#187;</li><li>德思礼一家谁也没有吭声。达力微微皱着眉头,似乎还在琢磨他到底受到了什么虐待。弗农姨父看上去像是喉咙里卡了什么东西。佩妮姨妈呢,却莫名其妙地涨红了脸。 &#187;</li><li>“And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.” &#187;</li><li>“好了,哈利,让我们走进黑夜里,去追逐那个轻浮而诱人的妖妇——冒险吧。” &#187;</li><li>Courtesy dictates that we offer fellow wizards the opportunity of denying us entry. &#187;</li><li>礼貌要求我们向别的巫师提供拒绝我们的机会。 &#187;</li><li>“No, I thought not. You have not asked me, for instance, what is my favorite flavor of jam, to check that I am indeed Professor Dumbledore and not an impostor.” &#187;</li><li>“是啊,我也认为没用。比如,你并没有问我最喜欢哪一种果酱, 以此来检验我是否确实是邓布利多教授,而不是一个冒牌货。” &#187;</li><li>He seemed remarkably unabashed for a man who had just been discovered pretending to be an armchair. &#187;</li><li>看来他的脸皮厚得惊人,要知道他刚刚可是装成了一把扶手椅被人识破的。 &#187;</li><li>He pushed past Harry, his face turned resolutely away with the air of a man trying to resist temptation. &#187;</li><li>他推开哈利走了过去,并且坚决地把脸转向一边,像在抵御什么诱惑似的。 &#187;</li><li>Slughorn eyed Dumbledore balefully for a moment, then muttered, “I haven’t given them the chance. I’ve been on the move for a year. Never stay in one place more than a week. Move from Muggle house to Muggle house — the owners of this place are on holiday in the Canary Islands — it’s been very pleasant, I’ll be sorry to leave. It’s quite easy once you know how, one simple Freezing Charm on these absurd burglar alarms they use instead of Sneakoscopes and make sure the neighbors don’t spot you bringing in the piano.” &#187;</li><li>斯拉格霍恩恶狠狠地瞪了邓布利多片刻,然后低声说道:“我没有给他们机会。一年来,我一直行踪不定。待在一个地方从来不超过一个星期。从一处麻瓜住宅搬到另一处麻瓜住宅——这幢房子的主人正在加那利群岛 度假呢。我在这儿住得很舒服,真舍不得离开。一旦找到窍门就很容易啦,他们不用窥镜,而用那些可笑的防盗警报器,你只要在上面施一个冰冻魔咒,还有,搬钢琴进来时别让邻居们看见就行了。” &#187;</li><li>“Professor Umbridge ran afoul of our centaur herd,” said Dumbledore. “I think you, Horace, would have known better than to stride into the forest and call a horde of angry centaurs ‘filthy half-breeds.’ ” &#187;</li><li>“乌姆里奇教授跟我们的那些马人发生了冲突。”邓布利多说道,“我想,霍拉斯,你肯定不会大摇大摆地走进禁林,管一群愤怒的马人叫‘肮脏的杂种’吧。” &#187;</li><li>“Hmpf. Yes, well. You shouldn’t have favorites as a teacher, of course, but she was one of mine. Your mother,” Slughorn added, in answer to Harry’s questioning look. “Lily Evans. One of the brightest I ever taught. Vivacious, you know. Charming girl. I used to tell her she ought to have been in my House. Very cheeky answers I used to get back too.” &#187;</li><li>“哼,是啊。当然啦,作为一名教师,是不应该偏爱学生的,但我就是偏爱她。你的母亲,”斯拉格霍恩看到哈利疑问的目光,补充道,“莉莉·伊万丝,是我教过的最聪明的学生之一。活泼可爱。一个迷人的姑娘。我经常对她说,她应该在我的学院才是。我经常得到她很不客气的回答。” &#187;</li><li>Slughorn seemed agitated. He twiddled his fat thumbs and fidgeted as he watched Dumbledore fasten his traveling cloak, and Harry zip up his jacket. &#187;</li><li>斯拉格霍恩显得很不安。他摆弄着两根胖胖的大拇指,焦虑地看着邓布利多裹紧了旅行斗篷,哈利拉上了他的夹克衫拉链。 &#187;</li><li>“Yes, yes,” said Slughorn impatiently. “I must be mad, but yes.” &#187;</li><li>“是啊,是啊,”斯拉格霍恩不耐烦地说,“我肯定是疯了,但是没错,我愿意。” &#187;</li><li>Harry had a sudden and vivid mental image of a great swollen spider, spinning a web around it, twitching a thread here and there to bring its large and juicy flies a little closer. &#187;</li><li>哈利脑海里立刻出现了一只胖鼓鼓的大蜘蛛,它这里吐一根丝,那里吐一根丝,在身体周围结了一张网,把美味多汁的大苍蝇引到自己身边来。 &#187;</li><li>“I hope you will forgive me for mentioning it, Harry, but I am pleased and a little proud at how well you seem to be coping after everything that happened at the Ministry. Permit me to say that I think Sirius would have been proud of you.” &#187;</li><li>“哈利,希望你能原谅我提起这个话题,但是在部里发生了那些事情之后,你似乎一直对付得不错,对此我很高兴,还有点儿自豪。请允许我说一句,我认为小天狼星也会为你感到自豪的。” &#187;</li><li>“It’s just hard,” Harry said finally, in a low voice, “to realize he won’t write to me again.” &#187;</li><li>“很难相信,”哈利终于低声说道,“他再也不会给我写信了。” &#187;</li><li>“Sirius represented much to you that you had never known before,” said Dumbledore gently. “Naturally, the loss is devastating. …” &#187;</li><li>“对你来说,小天狼星代表着许多你以前从不知道的东西。”邓布利多温和地说,“失去他肯定令你感到无比痛苦……” &#187;</li><li>“But while I was at the Dursleys’ …” interrupted Harry, his voice growing stronger, “I realized I can’t shut myself away or — or crack up. Sirius wouldn’t have wanted that, would he? And anyway, life’s too short. …Look at Madam Bones, look at Emmeline Vance. … It could be me next, couldn’t it? But if it is,” he said fiercely, now looking straight into Dumbledore’s blue eyes gleaming in the wandlight, “I’ll make sure I take as many Death Eaters with me as I can, and Voldemort too if I can manage it.” &#187;</li><li>“可是我在德思礼家的时候,”哈利打断了他的话,声音变得有力了,“我知道我不能把自己封闭起来,也不能——不能自暴自弃。小天狼星肯定不愿意这样,是吗?而且生命太短暂了……看看博恩斯夫人, 看看爱米琳·万斯……下一个可能就是我,对吗?如果真的轮到我,”他直视着邓布利多那双在魔杖的亮光下闪烁的蓝眼睛,激动地说道,“我一定要尽量多消灭几个食死徒,如果可能的话,就跟伏地魔同归于尽。” &#187;</li><li>“Spoken both like your mother and father’s son and Sirius’s true godson!” said Dumbledore, with an approving pat on Harry’s back. “I take my hat off to you — or I would, if I were not afraid of showering you in spiders. &#187;</li><li>“说得好,不愧是你父母的儿子、小天狼星的教子!”邓布利多说着赞许地拍了拍哈利的后背,“我要脱帽向你表示敬意——我很想这么做,但我担心会弄得你满身都是蜘蛛。 &#187;</li><li>“A wise decision, on the whole,” said Dumbledore. “Although I think you ought to relax it in favor of your friends, Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Hermione Granger. Yes,” he continued, when Harry looked startled, “I think they ought to know. You do them a disservice by not confiding something this important to them.” &#187;</li><li>“总的来说,这么做是明智的,”邓布利多说,“不过我认为你不妨在你的朋友罗恩·韦斯莱先生和赫敏·格兰杰小姐面前松松口。是啊,”看到哈利惊愕的神色,他又说道,“我认为可以让他们知道。你把这么重要的事情瞒着他们,会伤害他们的感情的。” &#187;</li><li>“— to worry or frighten them?” said Dumbledore, surveying Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles. “Or perhaps, to confess that you yourself are worried and frightened? You need your friends, Harry. As you so rightly said, Sirius would not have wanted you to shut yourself away.” &#187;</li><li>“——让他们担惊受怕?”邓布利多从他的半月形眼镜片上方打量着哈利,说道,“或者,不想坦白你自己的担心和恐惧?哈利,你需要朋友。你刚才说得对,小天狼星肯定不愿意你把自己封闭起来。” &#187;</li><li>“I think the word ‘fiasco’ would be a good one here,” said Dumbledore, nodding. Harry laughed. &#187;</li><li>“我认为‘彻底失败’这个词用在这里很合适。”邓布利多点点头说。 哈利笑了起来。 &#187;</li><li>“And lastly, while you stay here, the Burrow has been given the highest security the Ministry of Magic can provide. These measures have caused a certain amount of inconvenience to Arthur and Molly — all their post, for instance, is being searched at the Ministry before being sent on. They do not mind in the slightest, for their only concern is your safety. However, it would be poor repayment if you risked your neck while staying with them.” &#187;</li><li>“最后,你住在这里时,陋居得到了魔法部所能提供的最严密的安全保护。这些措施给亚瑟和莫丽带来了一定程度的不便——比如,他们所有的邮件都要经部里审查后才能送达。但他们丝毫不介意,一心只牵挂着你的安全。可是,如果你跟他们住在一起时冒险胡来,可就太对不起他们了。” &#187;</li><li>Let us not deprive Molly any longer of the chance to deplore how thin you are. &#187;</li><li>我们就让莫丽赶紧有机会哀叹你有多么瘦吧。 &#187;</li><li>Hedwig hooted happily at Harry from her perch on top of a large wardrobe, then took off through the window; Harry knew she had been waiting to see him before going hunting. &#187;</li><li>海德薇在一个大衣柜顶上朝哈利高兴地叫了几声,然后便振翅飞出了窗外,哈利知道它一直在等着见他一面之后才去觅食。 &#187;</li><li>It was the same last time he was powerful, people eloping left, right, and center —”“Including you and Dad,” said Ginny slyly. &#187;</li><li>上次神秘人得势的时候就是这样,到处都有人私奔——”“包括你和爸爸。”金妮调皮地说。 &#187;</li><li>“Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right,” said Hermione. &#187;</li><li>“邓布利多说,人们容易原谅别人的错误,却很难原谅别人的正确。”赫敏说 &#187;</li><li>Harry did not really listen. A warmth was spreading through him that had nothing to do with the sunlight; a tight obstruction in his chest seemed to be dissolving. He knew that Ron and Hermione were more shocked than they were letting on, but the mere fact that they were still there on either side of him, speaking bracing words of comfort, not shrinking from him as though he were contaminated or dangerous, was worth more than he could ever tell them. &#187;</li><li>哈利并没有认真地听。他感到全身暖融融的,而且这暖意跟阳光毫无关系,堵在他胸口的那块东西似乎正在渐渐融化。他知道罗恩和赫敏并没有把内心的恐惧都显露出来,但看到他们仍然和他站在一起,说着安慰和鼓励的话,而没有把他当成异类或危险分子,远远地躲开,他觉得这价值是他无法用语言向他们表达的。 &#187;</li><li>Mrs. Weasley squeezed past them and opened the kitchen window. One, two, three, the owls soared through it and landed on the table in a neat line. All three of them lifted their right legs. &#187;</li><li>韦斯莱夫人挤过他们身边,打开了厨房的窗户。一只、两只、三只猫头鹰从窗口飞了进来,落在桌子上,整整齐齐地站成一排,步调一致地抬起了右腿。 &#187;</li><li>ORDINARY WIZARDING LEVEL RESULTS Pass Grades Fail Grades Outstanding (O) Poor (P) Exceeds Expectations (E) Dreadful (D) Acceptable (A) Troll (T) &#187;</li><li>“Well, we’re N.E.W.T. students now!” grinned Ron. “Mum, are there any more sausages?” &#187;</li><li>“太好了,我们现在是N.E.W.Ts的学生了!”罗恩笑着说,“妈妈,还有香肠吗?” &#187;</li><li>It was odd, really, seeing that it had been a Death Eater in disguise who had first told Harry he would make a good Auror, but somehow the idea had taken hold of him, and he couldn’t really think of anything else he would like to be. Moreover, it had seemed the right destiny for him since he had heard the prophecy a few weeks ago. … Neither can live while the other survives. … Wouldn’t he be living up to the prophecy, and giving himself the best chance of survival, if he joined those highly trained wizards whose job it was to find and kill Voldemort? &#187;</li><li>说来也奇怪,最初告诉哈利他会成为一名出色的傲罗的,是一个伪装的食死徒,但不知怎的,这个想法在哈利心里生了根,他想象不出除此之外他还愿意做什么。而且,自从一个月前听了那个预言之后,这似乎已是他注定的命运……两个人不能都活着……如果他加入那支足智多谋、以追捕和消灭伏地魔为己任的巫师队伍,他岂不是就能实施那个预言,给自己一个最大的生存机会吗? &#187;</li><li>“That’s right. … Well, we thought Shield Hats were a bit of a laugh, you know, challenge your mate to jinx you while wearing it and watch his face when the jinx just bounces off. But the Ministry bought five hundred for all its support staff! And we’re still getting massive orders!” &#187;</li><li>“没错……嘿,我们本来以为防咒帽只是一种搞笑的玩意儿。你知道的,就是你戴着这种帽子叫你的同伴给你施恶咒,然后你盯着他的脸,恶咒就会反弹出去。没想到魔法部给他们所有的工作人员买了五百顶!现在我们还不断接到大额订单呢!” &#187;</li><li>“Our feet’ll be seen!” said Hermione anxiously, as the cloak flapped a little around their ankles; it was much more difficult hiding all three of them under the cloak nowadays. &#187;</li><li>“我们的脚会被人看见的!”赫敏担心地说,因为隐形衣的下摆在他们脚脖子周围掀动着。如今,他们三个人藏在它下面比以前困难多了。 &#187;</li><li>“People expect you to have cooler friends than us,” said Luna, once again displaying her knack for embarrassing honesty. &#187;</li><li>“人们认为你应该有比我们更带劲的朋友。”卢娜说,又一次显示了她哪壶不开提哪壶的本领。 &#187;</li><li>You should hear my gran talk about you. ‘That Harry Potter’s got more backbone than the whole Ministry of Magic put together!’ &#187;</li><li>你真该听听我奶奶是怎么说你的。‘那个哈利·波特比整个魔法部的人加在一起还有骨气!’ &#187;</li><li>“A Wrackspurt … They’re invisible. They float in through your ears and make your brain go fuzzy,” she said. “I thought I felt one zooming around in here.” &#187;</li><li>“骚扰虻……它们是隐形的,会飘到你耳朵里,把你的脑子搞乱。”她说,“我刚才好像觉得有一只在这里嗡嗡地飞。” &#187;</li><li>He contemplated Harry for a moment as though he was a particularly large and succulent piece of pheasant &#187;</li><li>他沉思地端详着哈利,似乎哈利是一只肥墩墩的、美味多汁的鹌鹑 &#187;</li><li>The fury and hatred bubbling inside Harry seemed to blaze white-hot, but he would rather have been immobilized all the way back to London than tell Snape why he was late. &#187;</li><li>哈利内心的愤怒和仇恨简直白热化了,他宁愿全身僵硬地返回伦敦,也不愿告诉斯内普他迟到的原因。 &#187;</li><li>Still Harry remained silent, though he thought his chest might explode. He knew that Snape had come to fetch him for this, for the few minutes when he could needle and torment Harry without anyone else listening. &#187;</li><li>哈利仍然保持着沉默,尽管他觉得肺都要气炸了。他知道斯内普来接他就是为了这个,他可以有几分钟时间激怒和折磨哈利,而不会被任何人听见。 &#187;</li><li>“It looks as if it’s died,” said Hermione, with a nauseated expression. “But there are some injuries you can’t cure … old curses … and there are poisons without antidotes. …” &#187;</li><li>“那只手看上去像是死了。”赫敏脸上带着难受的表情说,“有些伤永远治不好……古老的咒语……还有一些魔药是没有解药的……” &#187;</li><li>Harry told him. It was a mark of the strength of their friendship that Ron did not laugh. &#187;</li><li>哈利把事情告诉了他。罗恩没有笑,这显示了他们的友谊是多么牢固。 &#187;</li><li>In fact, his ability to speak to serpents did not make me nearly as uneasy as his obvious instincts for cruelty, secrecy, and domination. &#187;</li><li>事实上,他与蛇对话的能力并没有使我感到很不安,令我担心的是他明显表现出来的那种残酷、诡秘和霸道的天性。 &#187;</li><li>I trust that you also noticed that Tom Riddle was already highly self- sufficient, secretive, and, apparently, friendless? &#187;</li><li>我相信你同样也注意到了,汤姆·里德尔当时已经极为自信,讳莫如深,而且显然没有一个朋友。 &#187;</li><li>“Very astute, Harry, but the mouth organ was only ever a mouth organ.” &#187;</li><li>“眼光很敏锐,哈利,但口琴只是一把口琴而已。” &#187;</li><li>It was as though something large and scaly erupted into life in Harry’s stomach, clawing at his insides: Hot blood seemed to flood his brain, so that all thought was extinguished, replaced by a savage urge to jinx Dean into a jelly. Wrestling with this sudden madness, he heard Ron’s voice as though from a great distance away. &#187;</li><li>似乎有个全身长鳞的大家伙在哈利心头突然活了起来,并用爪子抓挠着他的五脏六腑,热血一下子冲上了他的脑袋,所有的理性都被压制住了,取而代之的是一股强烈的冲动,只想用恶咒把迪安变成一堆果子冻。他与这种突如其来的疯狂念头搏斗着,听见罗恩的声音像是从很远的地方传来。 &#187;</li><li>Hermione slid off the desk. The little flock of golden birds continued to twitter in circles around her head so that she looked like a strange, feathery model of the solar system. &#187;</li><li>赫敏从讲台上滑了下来。那群金黄色的小鸟继续围着她的脑袋叽叽喳喳地飞着,这使她看上去像一个奇怪的、长着羽毛的太阳系模型。 &#187;</li><li>“I’m not talking about your stupid so-called Prince,” said Hermione, giving his book a nasty look as though it had been rude to her. “I’m talking about earlier. I went into the girls’ bathroom just before I came in here and there were about a dozen girls in there, including that Romilda Vane, trying to decide how to slip you a love potion. They’re all hoping they’re going to get you to take them to Slughorn’s party, and they all seem to have bought Fred and George’s love potions, which I’m afraid to say probably work —” &#187;</li><li>“我不是说你那个愚蠢的所谓王子,”赫敏凶巴巴地瞪了他的书一眼,好像它招惹了她似的,“我是说刚才,到这儿来之前,我去盥洗室,那儿有一打女孩子,包括罗米达·万尼,都在讨论着怎么能让你喝下迷情剂。她们都希望能被你带去参加斯拉格霍恩的晚会,而且好像都买了弗雷德和乔治的迷情剂——” &#187;</li><li>Parvati positively beamed. Harry could tell that she was feeling guilty for having laughed at Hermione in Transfiguration. He looked around and saw that Hermione was beaming back, if possible even more brightly. Girls were very strange sometimes. &#187;</li><li>帕瓦蒂满脸带笑,哈利看得出她在为变形课上笑了赫敏感到内疚。 他扭头一看,见赫敏也是一副笑容,如果可能的话,甚至可以说是灿烂的笑容。女孩子有时真是很奇怪。 &#187;</li><li>She left. At once Lavender and Parvati put their heads together to discuss this new development, with everything they had ever heard about McLaggen, and all they had ever guessed about Hermione. Ron looked strangely blank and said nothing. Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge. &#187;</li><li>她走了。拉文德和帕瓦蒂马上把脑袋凑在一起议论着这个新情况, 包括她们对麦克拉根的一切耳闻,以及她们对赫敏的一切猜测。罗恩表情异常麻木,一言不发。哈利留在那儿,思考着女孩子为了报复可以陷得有多深。 &#187;</li><li>Fred, George, Harry, and Ron were the only ones who knew that the angel on top of the tree was actually a garden gnome that had bitten Fred on the ankle as he pulled up carrots for Christmas dinner. Stupefied, painted gold, stuffed into a miniature tutu and with small wings glued to its back, it glowered down at them all, the ugliest angel Harry had ever seen, with a large bald head like a potato and rather hairy feet. &#187;</li><li>只有弗雷德、乔治、哈利和罗恩知道圣诞树顶上的小天使其实是一个花园小地精。弗雷德在拔圣诞晚餐用的胡萝卜时被这个小地精咬了脚踝,于是它被施了昏迷咒,涂成金色,塞进了一件小芭蕾舞裙,背上粘了对小翅膀,在树顶上对他们怒目而视。这是哈利见过的最丑的天使,长着土豆似的大秃脑袋,脚上还有毛。 &#187;</li><li>And the rest of the evening passed amicably with both of them abusing the Minister of Magic, for Hermione, like Ron, thought that after all the Ministry had put Harry through the previous year, they had a great deal of nerve asking him for help now. &#187;</li><li>晚上剩下的时间是在友好的气氛中度过的,两人共同批判了魔法部长。赫敏跟罗恩一样认为,魔法部去年让哈利吃了那么多苦头,现在又来找他帮忙,脸皮真够厚的。 &#187;</li><li>Lost in visions of this happy prospect, he flicked his wand a little too enthusiastically, so that instead of producing the fountain of pure water that was the object of today’s Charms lesson, he let out a hoselike jet that ricocheted off the ceiling and knocked Professor Flitwick flat on his face. &#187;</li><li>他沉浸在憧憬中,魔杖挥得劲太足了点儿,把那天魔咒课作业要变的一股清泉变成了一道水龙,射到天花板上反弹下来,正打在弗立维教授的脸上。 &#187;</li><li>“Ah, Harry, how often this happens, even between the best of friends! Each of us believes that what he has to say is much more important than anything the other might have to contribute!” &#187;</li><li>“啊,哈利,这是多么常见的事情,即使在最好的朋友之间!我们都相信自己要说的比对方的重要得多!” &#187;</li><li>I believe that it was then that he dropped the name forever, assumed the identity of Lord Voldemort, and began his investigations into his previously despised mother’s family — the woman whom, you will remember, he had thought could not be a witch if she had succumbed to the shameful human weakness of death. &#187;</li><li>我相信就是在那时他抛弃了这个名字,改称伏地魔的,并开始调查以前被他轻视的他母亲的家史——你应该记得,他认为那个女人既然屈从于死亡这一人类的可耻弱点,就不可能是巫师。 &#187;</li><li>Harry could not help but feel a resentful admiration for Voldemort’s complete lack of fear. &#187;</li><li>哈利不禁对伏地魔的毫无畏惧感到一种恼火的钦佩。 &#187;</li><li>“You are quite right — they can detect magic, but not the perpetrator: You will remember that you were blamed by the Ministry for the Hover Charm that was, in fact, cast by —” &#187;</li><li>“你说得很对——他们能测出魔法,但测不出施魔法者:你还记得魔法部指控你施了悬停魔咒,而实际上是——” &#187;</li><li>“The important things to remember when Apparating are the three D’s!”said Twycross. “Destination, Determination, Deliberation! &#187;</li><li>“幻影显形时最重要的是要记住三个D!”泰克罗斯说,“即目标,决心,从容 !” &#187;</li><li>“Half our family does seem to owe you their lives, now I stop and think about it,” Mr. Weasley said in a constricted voice. “Well, all I can say is that it was a lucky day for the Weasleys when Ron decided to sit in your compartment on the Hogwarts Express, Harry.” &#187;</li><li>“还真是,现在想起来,我们家好像有一半人的命都是你救的。”韦斯莱先生说,他的嗓子眼有些发紧,“我只能说,罗恩在霍格沃茨特快列车上决定坐在你的车厢里,那真是幸运的一天,哈利。” &#187;</li><li>“Ginny came in to visit while you were unconscious,” he said, after a long pause, and Harry’s imagination zoomed into overdrive, rapidly constructing a scene in which Ginny, weeping over his lifeless form, confessed her feelings of deep attraction to him while Ron gave them his blessing. … &#187;</li><li>“你昏迷的时候金妮来过。”停了好长时间,他说。哈利的想象立刻超速运转起来,飞快构思出一幕画面——金妮对着他没有知觉的身体抽泣,表白着她对他深深的爱恋,罗恩为他们俩祝福…… &#187;</li><li>“I see,” said Dumbledore eventually, peering at Harry over the top of his half-moon spectacles and giving Harry the usual sensation that he was being X-rayed. “And you feel that you have exerted your very best efforts in this matter, do you? That you have exercised all of your considerable ingenuity? That you have left no depth of cunning unplumbed in your quest to retrieve the memory?” &#187;</li><li>“噢,”邓布利多从半月形的眼镜片上方盯着哈利,哈利又有一种被X光照射的感觉,“你觉得已经尽了最大努力,是吗?已经充分发挥了你的聪明才智?想尽了一切点子?” &#187;</li><li>A hot, prickly feeling of shame spread from the top of Harry’s head all the way down his body. Dumbledore had not raised his voice, he did not even sound angry, but Harry would have preferred him to yell; this cold disappointment was worse than anything. &#187;</li><li>一阵火辣辣的、针扎一般的羞耻感从哈利的头顶传遍全身。邓布利多没有提高嗓门,甚至话语中也没带怒气,但哈利宁愿他大吼大叫,这种冰冷的失望比什么都令人难受。 &#187;</li><li>Silence fell between them again, the most uncomfortable silence Harry had ever experienced with Dumbledore; it seemed to go on and on, punctuated only by the little grunting snores of the portrait of Armando Dippet over Dumbledore’s head. Harry felt strangely diminished, as though he had shrunk a little since he had entered the room. &#187;</li><li>两人又沉默了,这是哈利在邓布利多身边经历过的最难堪的沉默, 它似乎无休无止,只是时而被邓布利多头顶上阿芒多·迪佩特哼哼哧哧的鼾声打断。哈利有一种奇怪的渺小感,好像自己进屋后缩小了。 &#187;</li><li>“I believe he had several reasons, though he confided none of them to Professor Dippet,” said Dumbledore. “Firstly, and very importantly, Voldemort was, I believe, more attached to this school than he has ever been to a person. Hogwarts was where he had been happiest; the first and only place he had felt at home.” &#187;</li><li>“我相信他有好几条理由,尽管他一条也没有告诉迪佩特教授。”邓布利多说,“首先,很重要的一条是,伏地魔对这所学校比他对任何个人更有感情。霍格沃茨是他最开心的地方,是他感到像家的第一个也是惟一的地方。” &#187;</li><li>“So Voldemort went off to Borgin and Burkes, and all the staff who had admired him said what a waste it was, a brilliant young wizard like that, working in a shop. However, Voldemort was no mere assistant. Polite and handsome and clever, he was soon given particular jobs of the type that only exist in a place like Borgin and Burkes, which specializes, as you know, Harry, in objects with unusual and powerful properties. Voldemort was sent to persuade people to part with their treasures for sale by the partners, and he was, by all accounts, unusually gifted at doing this.” &#187;</li><li>“伏地魔去了博金-博克,所有欣赏他的教员都说可惜,那样一个才华出众的年轻巫师去当了店员。但伏地魔不只是店员。他因为彬彬有礼,英俊聪明,很快就得到了只有博金-博克这种地方才有的特殊工作。你知道,哈利,这家店专销有特异性能的物品。伏地魔被派去说服别人将宝物交给店里出售,据说,他对此事特别擅长。” &#187;</li><li>“So, Tom … to what do I owe the pleasure?” &#187;</li><li>“那么,汤姆……是什么风把你吹来的?” &#187;</li><li>He raised his glass as though toasting Voldemort, whose face remained expressionless. Nevertheless, Harry felt the atmosphere in the room change subtly: Dumbledore’s refusal to use Voldemort’s chosen name was a refusal to allow Voldemort to dictate the terms of the meeting, and Harry could tell that Voldemort took it as such. &#187;</li><li>他举起杯子,像要跟伏地魔干杯。伏地魔还是面无表情。但哈利感到屋里的气氛发生了微妙的变化:邓布利多拒绝用伏地魔选定的称呼, 是拒绝让伏地魔支配谈话。哈利看得出伏地魔也感觉到了。 &#187;</li><li>Voldemort’s expression remained impassive as he said, “Greatness inspires envy, envy engenders spite, spite spawns lies. You must know this, Dumbledore.”“You call it ‘greatness,’ what you have been doing, do you?” asked Dumbledore delicately. &#187;</li><li>伏地魔依然面无表情,说道:“伟大引起嫉妒,嫉妒导致怨毒,怨毒滋生谎言。这你一定了解,邓布利多。”“你把你的所作所为称为‘伟大’,是吗?”邓布利多优雅地问。 &#187;</li><li>For the first time, Voldemort smiled. It was a taut leer, an evil thing, more threatening than a look of rage. &#187;</li><li>伏地魔第一次笑了,那是一种睥睨的讥笑,邪恶的表情,比暴怒更加可怕。 &#187;</li><li>“The old argument,” he said softly. “But nothing I have seen in the world has supported your famous pronouncements that love is more powerful than my kind of magic, Dumbledore.” &#187;</li><li>“老论调,”他轻声说,“可是,邓布利多,我在世上所见没有一样能证明你那著名的观点:爱比我那种魔法更加强大。” &#187;</li><li>Dumbledore set down his empty glass and drew himself up in his seat, the tips of his fingers together in a very characteristic gesture. &#187;</li><li>邓布利多放下空杯子,坐直身子,双手指尖碰在一起,这是他惯有的姿势。 &#187;</li><li>“No, nothing,” said Dumbledore, and a great sadness filled his face. “The time is long gone when I could frighten you with a burning wardrobe and force you to make repayment for your crimes. But I wish I could, Tom. … I wish I could. …” &#187;</li><li>“没有了。”邓布利多说,脸上露出深深的悲哀,“我能用燃烧的衣柜吓住你,迫使你赎罪的时间早已过去。可我希望能,汤姆……我希望能……” &#187;</li><li>Harry did not answer for a moment. Then, slowly but surely, an exhilarating sense of infinite opportunity stole through him; he felt as though he could have done anything, anything at all … and getting the memory from Slughorn seemed suddenly not only possible, but positively easy. … &#187;</li><li>哈利一时没有回答,接着,慢慢地但是确确实实地,一种无比振奋的感觉流向全身,仿佛有无限的机会。他感到自己能做任何事,一切事……从斯拉格霍恩那里搞到记忆突然好像不仅可能,而且简直是轻而易举…… &#187;</li><li>Slughorn raised a pudgy hand and pressed his shaking fingers to his mouth; he looked for a moment like an enormously overgrown baby. &#187;</li><li>斯拉格霍恩举起胖手,把颤抖的手指按到嘴上,他一时看上去像个庞大的婴儿。 &#187;</li><li>It was very well done, thought Harry, the hesitancy, the casual tone, the careful flattery, none of it overdone. He, Harry, had had too much experience of trying to wheedle information out of reluctant people not to recognize a master at work. He could tell that Riddle wanted the information very, very much; perhaps had been working toward this moment for weeks. &#187;</li><li>恰到好处,哈利想,那种犹豫、不经意的语气,巧妙的恭维,一点儿都没有过火。哈利自己有过太多从不情愿的人嘴里套取信息的经历, 不会认不出一个行家。他看得出里德尔非常非常想要这个信息,也许为这一刻已经筹划了好几个星期。 &#187;</li><li>“Well, you split your soul, you see,” said Slughorn, “and hide part of it in an object outside the body. Then, even if one’s body is attacked or destroyed, one cannot die, for part of the soul remains earthbound and undamaged. But of course, existence in such a form …” &#187;</li><li>“就是说,你把你的灵魂分裂开,”斯拉格霍恩说,“将一部分藏在身体外的某个物体中。这样,即使你的身体遭到袭击或摧毁,你也死不了,因为还有一部分灵魂留在世间,未受损害。但是,当然,以这种形式存在……” &#187;</li><li>“By an act of evil — the supreme act of evil. By committing murder. Killing rips the soul apart. The wizard intent upon creating a Horcrux would use the damage to his advantage: He would encase the torn portion —” &#187;</li><li>“通过邪恶的行为——最邪恶的行为,通过谋杀。杀人会使灵魂分裂,想要制造魂器的巫师则利用这种破坏,把分裂出的灵魂碎片封存——” &#187;</li><li>Yet it fitted: Lord Voldemort has seemed to grow less human with the passing years, and the transformation he has undergone seemed to me to be only explicable if his soul was mutilated beyond the realms of what we might call ‘usual evil’ &#187;</li><li>种种迹象都很吻合——这些年来伏地魔似乎变得越来越不像人,我想那种变形只能解释为,他的灵魂受到的破坏超出了我们所说的一般邪恶的范围…… &#187;</li><li>“So,” said Harry, “the diary’s gone, the ring’s gone. The cup, the locket, and the snake are still intact, and you think there might be a Horcrux that was once Ravenclaw’s or Gryffindor’s?” &#187;</li><li>“那,日记毁了,戒指毁了,杯子、挂坠盒和蛇还在,你认为还有一个魂器可能是拉文克劳或格兰芬多的遗物?” &#187;</li><li>“I know!” said Harry impatiently. “I can love!” It was only with difficulty that he stopped himself adding, “Big deal!”“Yes, Harry, you can love,” said Dumbledore, who looked as though he knew perfectly well what Harry had just refrained from saying. “Which, given everything that has happened to you, is a great and remarkable thing. You are still too young to understand how unusual you are, Harry.” &#187;</li><li>“我知道!”哈利不耐烦地说,“我有爱!”他好容易才没有加上:“有什么了不起!”“是的,哈利,你有爱,”邓布利多好像十分了解哈利舌头底下压着的话,“想想你经历的一切,这是非常了不起的。你还太年轻,不知道你是多么特殊,哈利。” &#187;</li><li>“Yes — just love,” said Dumbledore. “But Harry, never forget that what the prophecy says is only significant because Voldemort made it so. I told you this at the end of last year. Voldemort singled you out as the person who would be most dangerous to him — and in doing so, he made you the person who would be most dangerous to him!” &#187;</li><li>“对——就是爱。”邓布利多说,“但是哈利,永远不要忘记,预言的意义只是伏地魔造成的。我去年年底跟你讲过这一点。伏地魔把你当成对他最危险的人——而这样一来,他就使你变成了对他最危险的人!” &#187;</li><li>“Harry, Harry, only because Voldemort made a grave error, and acted on Professor Trelawney’s words! If Voldemort had never murdered your father, would he have imparted in you a furious desire for revenge? Of course not! If he had not forced your mother to die for you, would he have given you a magical protection he could not penetrate? Of course not, Harry! Don’t you see? Voldemort himself created his worst enemy, just as tyrants everywhere do! Have you any idea how much tyrants fear the people they oppress? All of them realize that, one day, amongst their many victims, there is sure to be one who rises against them and strikes back! Voldemort is no different! Always he was on the lookout for the one who would challenge him. He heard the prophecy and he leapt into action, with the result that he not only handpicked the man most likely to finish him, he handed him uniquely deadly weapons!” &#187;</li><li>“哈利呀,哈利,那只是因为伏地魔犯了个大错误,他按特里劳妮教授的预言采取了行动!如果伏地魔没有杀死你父亲,会让你产生强烈的复仇欲望吗?当然不会!如果他没有逼你母亲为你而死,会让你得到他无法穿透的魔法保护吗?当然不会!哈利。你看不到吗?伏地魔自己制造了他最可怕的敌人,就像普天下的暴君一样!你知道暴君多么害怕被压迫的人民吗?他们都知道总有一天,在众多受害者中会有一个起来奋起反击!伏地魔也一样。他总是在寻找那个会向他挑战的人,听到预言后就马上行动,结果他不仅亲手选出了那个最有可能除掉他的人,而且给了他一件特别致命的武器!” &#187;</li><li>“It is essential that you understand this!” said Dumbledore, standing up and striding about the room, his glittering robes swooshing in his wake; Harry had never seen him so agitated. “By attempting to kill you, Voldemort himself singled out the remarkable person who sits here in front of me, and gave him the tools for the job! It is Voldemort’s fault that you were able to see into his thoughts, his ambitions, that you even understand the snakelike language in which he gives orders, and yet, Harry, despite your privileged insight into Voldemort’s world (which, incidentally, is a gift any Death Eater would kill to have), you have never been seduced by the Dark Arts, never, even for a second, shown the slightest desire to become one of Voldemort’s followers!” &#187;</li><li>“你必须明白这一点!”邓布利多站了起来,在屋子里大步地走来走去,闪亮的袍子在身后呼呼飘动。哈利还从没见他这么激动过,“在企图杀你的时候,伏地魔就亲自选出了坐在我面前的这个卓越的人,并为他提供了工具!你能看到伏地魔的思想、野心,甚至能听懂他发令时那蛇说话般的语言,这都只能怪他自己。可是,哈利,尽管你能洞察伏地魔的世界——要知道,这是任何食死徒不惜用杀人来换取的能力,但你却从未接受黑魔法的诱惑,从未显露过丝毫想要追随伏地魔的欲望,一秒钟都没有!” &#187;</li><li>“You are protected, in short, by your ability to love!” said Dumbledore loudly. “The only protection that can possibly work against the lure of power like Voldemort’s! In spite of all the temptation you have endured, all the suffering, you remain pure of heart, just as pure as you were at the age of eleven, when you stared into a mirror that reflected your heart’s desire, and it showed you only the way to thwart Lord Voldemort, and not immortality or riches. Harry, have you any idea how few wizards could have seen what you saw in that mirror? Voldemort should have known then what he was dealing with, but he did not! “But he knows it now. You have flitted into Lord Voldemort’s mind without damage to yourself, but he cannot possess you without enduring mortal agony, as he discovered in the Ministry. I do not think he understands why, Harry, but then, he was in such a hurry to mutilate his own soul, he never paused to understand the incomparable power of a soul that is untarnished and whole.” &#187;</li><li>“简而言之,是你的爱保护了你!”邓布利多大声说,“惟有这种保护,才有可能抵御伏地魔那样的权力的诱惑!虽然经历了那么多诱惑, 那么多痛苦,你依然心地纯洁,还像你十一岁时那样。当时你向那面能照出你内心愿望的镜子中望去,看到的只有怎样挫败伏地魔,而没有永生和财富。哈利,你知不知道,世上没有几个巫师能看到你在镜中看到的东西?伏地魔那时就该知道他要对付的是什么,可惜他没有! “但他现在知道了。你侵入了伏地魔的思想而不受损害,他想附在你身上时却不能不忍受剧烈的痛苦,他在部里已经发现了这一点。但我想他不了解这是为什么,哈利。他那样忙于破坏自己的灵魂,从来无暇去了解一个纯洁健全的灵魂拥有何等无与伦比的力量。” &#187;</li><li>Harry watched Dumbledore striding up and down in front of him, and thought. He thought of his mother, his father, and Sirius. He thought of Cedric Diggory. He thought of all the terrible deeds he knew Lord Voldemort had done. A flame seemed to leap inside his chest, searing his throat. &#187;</li><li>看着面前踱来踱去的邓布利多,哈利沉思起来。他想到了他的母亲、他的父亲和小天狼星,想到了塞德里克,想到了伏地魔的种种罪行。他的胸中腾起一股烈焰,直烧到喉咙口。 &#187;</li><li>“Of course you would!” cried Dumbledore. “You see, the prophecy does not mean you have to do anything! But the prophecy caused Lord Voldemort to mark you as his equal. … In other words, you are free to choose your way, quite free to turn your back on the prophecy! But Voldemort continues to set store by the prophecy. He will continue to hunt you … which makes it certain, really, that —” &#187;</li><li>“你当然会!”邓布利多叫道,“你看,预言并没表示你必须做什么!但预言使伏地魔认定你是他的对手……换句话说,你有权选择自己的道路,有权不理睬那个预言!但伏地魔还是会对它念念不忘,他会继续追杀你……所以确实是必然——” &#187;</li><li>But he understood at last what Dumbledore had been trying to tell him. It was, he thought, the difference between being dragged into the arena to face a battle to the death and walking into the arena with your head held high. Some people, perhaps, would say that there was little to choose between the two ways, but Dumbledore knew — and so do I, thought Harry, with a rush of fierce pride, and so did my parents — that there was all the difference in the world. &#187;</li><li>他终于明白了邓布利多要告诉他的意思,那就是:被拽进角斗场去面对一场殊死搏斗和自己昂首走进去是不同的。也许有人会说这二者之间并无多少不同,但邓布利多知道——我也知道,哈利带着一阵强烈的自豪感想道,我父母也知道——这是世界上全部的不同。 &#187;</li><li>“Coward,” said Hermione, though she looked amused. “Well, it was a bad night for romance all around. Ginny and Dean split up too, Harry.” &#187;</li><li>“懦夫,”赫敏说道,不过看上去挺愉快的,“哎,昨晚好像罗曼司普遍不利,金妮和迪安也分手了,哈利。” &#187;</li><li>. And to complicate matters, he had the nagging worry that if he didn’t do it, somebody else was sure to ask Ginny out soon: He and Ron were at least agreed on the fact that she was too popular for her own good. &#187;</li><li>更麻烦的是,他焦虑地想到如果自己不采取行动,肯定很快就会有别人约会金妮了。他和罗恩至少在这一点上看法是一致的:金妮太招人喜欢了,这对她本人没好处。 &#187;</li><li>Harry and Ron stared: Hermione and Ginny, who had always got on together very well, were now sitting with their arms folded, glaring in opposite directions. Ron looked nervously at Harry, then snatched up a book at random and hid behind it. Harry, however, little though he knew he deserved it, felt unbelievably cheerful all of a sudden, even though none of them spoke again for the rest of the evening. &#187;</li><li>哈利和罗恩目瞪口呆——向来关系很好的赫敏和金妮现在都抱着胳膊坐在那里,眼睛瞪着相反的方向。罗恩不安地看看哈利,然后随手抓起一本书,躲到书后面去了。哈利虽然知道自己不配,却还是突然感到难以置信的快乐,尽管他们一晚上都没有再说话。 &#187;</li><li>Harry looked around; there was Ginny running toward him; she had a hard, blazing look in her face as she threw her arms around him. And without thinking, without planning it, without worrying about the fact that fifty people were watching, Harry kissed her. &#187;</li><li>哈利看看周围,金妮向他奔来,她张开双臂抱住了他,脸上是一种炽烈的表情。于是,没有想,没有准备,没有担心有五十个人在看着, 哈利吻了她。 &#187;</li><li>After several long moments — or it might have been half an hour — or possibly several sunlit days — they broke apart. The room had gone very quiet. Then several people wolf-whistled and there was an outbreak of nervous giggling. Harry looked over the top of Ginny’s head to see Dean Thomas holding a shattered glass in his hand, and Romilda Vane looking as though she might throw something. Hermione was beaming, but Harry’s eyes sought Ron. At last he found him, still clutching the Cup and wearing an expression appropriate to having been clubbed over the head. For a fraction of a second they looked at each other, then Ron gave a tiny jerk of the head that Harry understood to mean, Well — if you must. &#187;</li><li>过了长长的几分钟——也可能有半个小时——或阳光灿烂的几天——他们才分开了。屋里变得非常安静。然后有几个人吹起了口哨,有人不自然地吃吃笑了起来。哈利越过金妮的头顶,看到迪安手里举着一个破杯子,罗米达·万尼好像要摔东西,赫敏在笑,但哈利的眼睛在寻找罗恩,终于找到了,他还攥着奖杯,看上去像当头挨了一棍似的。两人对视了片刻,罗恩的脑袋微微动了一下,哈利知道那意思是:“好吧——如果你一定要。” &#187;</li><li>“Enough,” said Dumbledore. He said it quite calmly, and yet Harry fell silent at once; he knew that he had finally crossed some invisible line. “Do you think that I have once left the school unprotected during my absences this year? I have not. Tonight, when I leave, there will again be additional protection in place. Please do not suggest that I do not take the safety of my students seriously, Harry.” &#187;</li><li>“够了。”邓布利多说。虽然他说得极其平静,但是哈利马上沉默下来,因为他知道自己最终越过了一道看不见的底线,“你以为今年我有哪次是毫无保护措施就离开学校的吗?我还没有过。今晚,当我离开时,各处将会有额外的防御措施。请不要认为我没有认真对待我的学生们的安全,哈利。” &#187;</li><li>Harry could smell salt and hear rushing waves; a light, chilly breeze ruffled his hair as he looked out at moonlit sea and star-strewn sky. He was standing upon a high outcrop of dark rock, water foaming and churning below him. He glanced over his shoulder. A towering cliff stood behind them, a sheer drop, black and faceless. A few large chunks of rock, such as the one upon which Harry and Dumbledore were standing, looked as though they had broken away from the cliff face at some point in the past. It was a bleak, harsh view, the sea and the rock unrelieved by any tree or sweep of grass or sand. &#187;</li><li>哈利可以闻到大海的气味,听见波涛汹涌的声音。他望着远处月光下的大海和繁星点点的夜空,一阵寒冷的微风吹拂着他的头发。他站在一块露出海面的高高的黑色岩石上,海浪在他脚下翻滚,泛起泡沫。他扭头朝后望去。身后耸立着一座悬崖,陡峭的岩壁直落而下,黑糊糊的看不清面目。几块很大的岩石,如哈利和邓布利多站着的这块,似乎是过去某个时候从悬崖的正面脱落下来的。四下里光秃秃的,满目荒凉, 除了苍茫的大海和岩石,看不见一棵树,也没有草地和沙滩。 &#187;</li><li>“Lumos,” said Dumbledore, as he reached the boulder closest to the cliff face. A thousand flecks of golden light sparkled upon the dark surface of the water a few feet below where he crouched; the black wall of rock beside him was illuminated too. &#187;</li><li>“荧光闪烁!”邓布利多下到最靠近悬崖正面的那块巨型卵石上,蹲下身念了句咒语。星星点点的金光在他身下几英尺处的黝黑海面上闪烁着。他身边那道漆黑的岩壁也被照亮了。 &#187;</li><li>Harry did not ask how Dumbledore knew. He had never seen a wizard work things out like this, simply by looking and touching; but Harry had long since learned that bangs and smoke were more often the marks of ineptitude than expertise. &#187;</li><li>哈利没有问邓布利多是怎么知道的。他从没见过哪个巫师这样解决难题:只用眼睛看,用手摸。不过哈利早就知道,弄得乒乒乓乓、烟雾大作的,通常是水平较低的人的特点,而不是高手的做派。 &#187;</li><li>Once again, Lord Voldemort fails to grasp that there are much more terrible things than physical injury. &#187;</li><li>伏地魔又一次没能理解,有许多东西比肉体的伤害更可怕得多。 &#187;</li><li>“I am not worried, Harry,” said Dumbledore, his voice a little stronger despite the freezing water. “I am with you.” &#187;</li><li>“我不担心,哈利,”邓布利多说,尽管海水寒冷刺骨,他的声音却多了一点儿气力,“我和你在一起呢。” &#187;</li><li>“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore, and Harry saw his feet slide a little on the floor as he struggled to remain upright. “But as for being about to kill me, Draco, you have had several long minutes now, we are quite alone, I am more defenseless than you can have dreamed of finding me, and still you have not acted. …” &#187;</li><li>“是的,我很在意。”邓布利多说,这时哈利看见他双脚在地面上打了一个滑,使劲撑着不让自己瘫倒,“至于你要取我性命的事,德拉科,已经过去好几分钟了。周围没有别人,我现在手无寸铁,你做梦也不会想到有这样的好机会,可你还是没有动手……” &#187;</li><li>The sound frightened Harry beyond anything he had experienced all evening. For the first time, Dumbledore was pleading. &#187;</li><li>这声音比哈利整晚经历的任何事情都叫他害怕。邓布利多在哀求, 这可是破天荒的第一次。 &#187;</li><li>A jet of green light shot from the end of Snape’s wand and hit Dumbledore squarely in the chest. Harry’s scream of horror never left him; silent and unmoving, he was forced to watch as Dumbledore was blasted into the air. For a split second, he seemed to hang suspended beneath the shining skull, and then he fell slowly backward, like a great rag doll, over the battlements and out of sight. &#187;</li><li>斯内普的魔杖尖上射出一道绿光,不偏不倚地击中了邓布利多的胸膛。哈利惊恐的尖叫声被憋在了喉咙里,他发不出声音,也动弹不得, 只能眼睁睁地望着邓布利多被击到空中。邓布利多似乎在那闪亮的骷髅下停留了一秒钟,然后像一个破烂的大玩偶似的,慢慢地仰面倒下去, 从围墙的垛口上栽下去不见了。 &#187;</li><li>And he slashed at the air: Harry felt a white-hot, whiplike something hit him across the face and was slammed backward into the ground. Spots of light burst in front of his eyes and for a moment all the breath seemed to have gone from his body, then he heard a rush of wings above him and something enormous obscured the stars. Buckbeak had flown at Snape, who staggered backward as the razor-sharp claws slashed at him. As Harry raised himself into a sitting position, his head still swimming from its last contact with the ground, he saw Snape running as hard as he could, the enormous beast flapping behind him and screeching as Harry had never heard him screech — &#187;</li><li>斯内普猛烈地抽打着空气。哈利感到有种白热的、像鞭子一样的东西打在脸上。他被重重地抽倒在地上,满眼冒着金星,有一阵子好像停止了呼吸。就在这时,他听见一阵翅膀的扑棱声,巨大的影子遮住了天空中的星星。巴克比克已经飞到了斯内普的头上,刀一样锋利的爪子抓得斯内普连连后退。哈利坐了起来,刚才撞到地上的脑袋还眩晕着,只见斯内普拼命奔跑着,巨大的巴克比克拍着翅膀在后面紧追不放,发出一种哈利从未听过的尖厉吼叫—— &#187;</li><li>Harry felt a searing pain in his stomach at the sound of the name. In the silence and the stillness, horror rose inside him. &#187;</li><li>一听到邓布利多的名字,哈利的胃里一阵剧烈的灼痛。沉默和寂静中,恐惧感在体内增长。 &#187;</li><li>Harry did not attempt to argue or explain. He was still shaking uncontrollably. Hagrid would find out soon enough, too soon. … As they directed their steps back toward the castle, Harry saw that many of its windows were lit now. He could imagine, clearly, the scenes inside as people moved from room to room, telling each other that Death Eaters had got in, that the Mark was shining over Hogwarts, that somebody must have been killed. … &#187;</li><li>哈利也不再试图争辩或解释了。他仍然不由自主地瑟瑟发抖。海格很快就会知道的……当他们朝城堡走去时,哈利见到许多窗子里的灯都亮了。他可以清楚地想象里面的情景,大家奔走相告,描述食死徒刚刚进来的情景,黑魔标记闪耀在霍格沃茨魔法学校的上空,一定有人被杀了…… &#187;</li><li>Harry heard Hagrid’s moan of pain and shock, but he did not stop; he walked slowly forward until he reached the place where Dumbledore lay and crouched down beside him. He had known there was no hope from the moment that the full Body-Bind Curse Dumbledore had placed upon him lifted, known that it could have happened only because its caster was dead, but there was still no preparation for seeing him here, spread-eagled, broken: the greatest wizard Harry had ever, or would ever, meet. &#187;</li><li>哈利听见了海格痛苦和震惊的呻吟声,但他没有停住脚步,继续慢慢地向前移动,直到他走到邓布利多躺着的地方,蹲在他的身旁。 当邓布利多施在他身上的全身束缚咒解开后,哈利就知道没有希望了,如果施魔咒的人不死,魔咒是不会自然解开的。但是哈利仍没有心理准备见到眼前这一幕:他今生今世遇到的、也许以后再也遇不到的最好的巫师,四肢摊开,手脚折断,横躺在眼前。 &#187;</li><li>Dumbledore’s eyes were closed; but for the strange angle of his arms and legs, he might have been sleeping. Harry reached out, straightened the half- moon spectacles upon the crooked nose, and wiped a trickle of blood from the mouth with his own sleeve. Then he gazed down at the wise old face and tried to absorb the enormous and incomprehensible truth: that never again would Dumbledore speak to him, never again could he help. … &#187;</li><li>邓布利多双眼紧闭,从他四肢摊开的角度看起来像是在熟睡。哈利伸手扶正那鹰钩鼻上的半月形眼镜,用自己的袖子擦了一下他嘴角的血痕,然后低头凝视着那张充满智慧的苍老的脸庞,努力地去面对这个难以接受的事实:邓布利多再也不会对他说什么了,再也不可能帮他什么了…… &#187;</li><li>A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry’s vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase. &#187;</li><li>一只小了许多的、更加温暖的手握住了哈利的手,把他向上拉着。 哈利糊里糊涂地顺势站了起来,直到他茫然地穿过人群,从空气中飘来了一丝花香,这才意识到是金妮一直在拉着他往城堡里走。听不清楚的话语从四面传来,抽泣、叫喊和哀号划破了夜空,但哈利和金妮继续向前,走上台阶,进入门厅。一张张面孔在哈利视线边缘晃动,人们盯着他,窃窃私语,惊愕迷茫。他们向大理石楼梯走去,格兰芬多的红宝石散落在地上,闪耀着血滴一样的红光。 &#187;</li><li>Gulping, Madam Pomfrey pressed her fingers to her mouth, her eyes wide. Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty. And Harry felt, as he had felt about phoenix song before, that the music was inside him, not without: It was his own grief turned magically to song that echoed across the grounds and through the castle windows. &#187;</li><li>庞弗雷夫人用手捂住嘴,咽着泪水,眼睛睁得大大的。在外面黑暗中的某个地方,凤凰正在用哈利从未听过的方式唱着令人动容的凄婉挽歌。像以前听凤凰的歌声一样,哈利感觉到这首挽歌的曲子是在他的脑海里,而不是在现实中,仿佛是他自己的悲伤化作了挽歌,在校园里和城堡的窗户间回荡。 &#187;</li><li>“You thought I would not weesh to marry him? Or per’aps, you hoped?”said Fleur, her nostrils flaring. “What do I care how he looks? I am good- looking enough for both of us, I theenk! All these scars show is zat my husband is brave! And I shall do zat!” she added fiercely, pushing Mrs. Weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her. &#187;</li><li>“你认为我会不想和他结婚?或者你希望我不想和他结婚?”芙蓉说,鼻翼翕动,“我只是在乎他的长相吗?我认为我一个人的美貌对我们俩来说已经足够了!所有这些伤疤说明我的丈夫是勇敢的!我来!”她气势汹汹地加了一句,一边推开韦斯莱太太,从她手中抢过药膏。 &#187;</li><li>And then, Harry did not quite see how it happened, both women were crying and hugging each other. Completely bewildered, wondering whether the world had gone mad, he turned around: Ron looked as stunned as he felt and Ginny and Hermione were exchanging startled looks. &#187;</li><li>突然,哈利还没有反应过来是怎么回事——两个女人抱头痛哭。哈利被彻底搞糊涂了,转过身去,怀疑这个世界是不是疯了。罗恩看起来和哈利一样惊讶。金妮和赫敏也在交换着惊讶的眼神。 &#187;</li><li>“Dumbledore would have been happier than anybody to think that there was a little more love in the world,” said Professor McGonagall curtly, just as the hospital doors opened again and Hagrid walked in. &#187;</li><li>“如果这个世界拥有更多的爱,邓布利多会比任何人都更高兴。”麦格教授简短地说,这时门又开了,海格走了进来。 &#187;</li><li>And he knew, without knowing how he knew it, that the phoenix had gone, had left Hogwarts for good, just as Dumbledore had left the school, had left the world … had left Harry. &#187;</li><li>他知道——虽然搞不清为什么会知道——凤凰已经走了,永远地离开了霍格沃茨,像邓布利多一样永远地离开了学校,离开了这个世界……离开了哈利。 &#187;</li><li>An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs; shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognize, but a few he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt; Mad-Eye Moody; Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink; Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley; Bill supported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragon skin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two and a half chairs on her own; Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron in London; Arabella Figg, Harry’s Squib neighbor; the hairy bass player from the Wizarding group the Weird Sisters; Ernie Prang, driver of the Knight Bus; Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley; and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog’s Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express. The castle ghosts were there too, barely visible in the bright sunlight, discernible only when they moved, shimmering insubstantially on the gleaming air. &#187;</li><li>一半椅子上已经坐了人,这些人各式各样,鱼龙混杂:有衣衫褴褛的,也有整洁体面的;有老年人,也有年轻人。大多数人哈利都不认识,但有一些他是知道的,其中包括凤凰社的成员:金斯莱·沙克尔, 疯眼汉穆迪,唐克斯——她的头发又奇迹般地变成了耀眼的粉红色,莱姆斯·卢平——唐克斯跟他手拉着手,韦斯莱夫妇,还有芙蓉搀扶着比尔,后面跟着穿黑色火龙皮夹克衫的弗雷德和乔治。此外还有马克西姆夫人——她一个人就占了两把半椅子,破釜酒吧的老板汤姆,哈利的哑炮邻居阿拉贝拉·费格,古怪姐妹演唱组里那位毛发粗重的低音提琴手,骑士公共汽车驾驶员厄恩·普兰,对角巷长袍专卖店的摩金夫人, 还有几个人哈利只是看着面熟,如猪头酒吧的那个服务员,霍格沃茨特快列车上推小车的女巫。城堡里的幽灵也来了,在阳光下几乎看不见他们,只有走动时才能辨认出来,在明亮的空气中闪烁着虚幻的光芒。 &#187;</li><li>She met Harry’s gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say, “Be careful,” or “Don’t do it,” but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him. And so he steeled himself to say what he had known he must say ever since Dumbledore had died. &#187;</li><li>但金妮已经不哭了,她迎着哈利的目光,神情刚毅而热烈,就像哈利缺席的那天球队赢得魁地奇杯后她拥抱哈利的时候那样。在那一刻,哈利知道他们彼此心心相印,知道当他把他要做的事情告诉她时,她不会说“你要小心”或“你别去做”, 而是会欣然接受他的决定,因为她从心底里知道他就是那样一个人。于是,他咬咬牙,说出了自从邓布利多死后他就知道非说不可的话。 &#187;</li><li>Harry looked at him, startled; the idea that anything as normal as a wedding could still exist seemed incredible and yet wonderful. &#187;</li><li>哈利不胜惊讶地望着他。世界上仍然存在婚礼这样平凡的事情,真是令人不可思议,同时也令人感到美妙无比。 &#187;</li><li>His hand closed automatically around the fake Horcrux, but in spite of everything, in spite of the dark and twisting path he saw stretching ahead for himself, in spite of the final meeting with Voldemort he knew must come, whether in a month, in a year, or in ten, he felt his heart lift at the thought that there was still one last golden day of peace left to enjoy with Ron and Hermione. &#187;</li><li>他的手不由自主地握紧了那个假魂器,尽管种种的一切,尽管等待他的是一条漆黑而曲折的道路,尽管他知道最后——不管是一个月、一年、或是十年之后——他肯定要跟伏地魔面对面地较量,可是想到他仍然可以和罗恩、赫敏一起享受最后一个黄金般的平静日子,他就感到心情无比的愉快。 &#187;</li></ol><div class=post-meta></hr>注：本作品采用<a
